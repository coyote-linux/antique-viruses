 General Comments: 
       The Civil War virus was submitted in November, 1992, and appears to 
       be from The Netherlands.  Civil War is a non-resident direct action 
       infector of .COM programs, but not COMMAND.COM.  Later versions of 
       this virus, including Civil War II v1.1 and Proto-T, listed below 
       under variants, are memory resident infectors of .COM programs, and 
       may infect COMMAND.COM.  The Civil War III v1.0 variant can also 
       infect .EXE programs.  Later versions of the Civil War virus are 
       encrypted, and listed under the  TPE  entry as anti-viral software 
       will most likely identify the encryption engine rather than the 
       virus present. 
 
       When a program infected with the Civil War virus is executed, this 
       virus will infect one .COM program located in the current directory. 
       Infected programs will have a file length increase of 244 bytes 
       with the virus being located at the end of the file.  The program's 
       date and time in the DOS disk directory listing will not be altered. 
       The following text strings are visible within the viral code in all 
       Civil War infected programs: 
 
               "Civil War, (c) 1992 Dark Helmet" 
               "*.com" 
 
       Known variant(s) of Civil War are: 
       Civil War II v1.0: Received in September, 1993, Civil War II v1.0 
                is a later version of the Civil War virus described above. 
                The first time an infected program is executed, this virus 
                will install itself memory resident at the top of system 
                memory but below the 640K DOS boundary.  Total system and 
                available free memory, as indicated by the DOS CHKDSK 
                program, will have decreased by 1,024 bytes.  Interrupt 21 
                will be hooked by the virus in memory.  Once Civil War II 
                v1.0 is memory resident, it will infect .COM programs, but 
                not COMMAND.COM, when they are executed.  Infected programs 
                will have a file length increase of 580 bytes with the virus 
                being located at the end of the file.  The file's date and 
                time in the DOS disk directory listing will not be altered. 
                The following text string is visible within the viral code in 
                all infected programs: 
                "Civil War II v1.0,(c) 06/03/1992 The Netherlands" 
                Origin: The Netherlands  September, 1993. 
       Civil War II v1.1: Received in November, 1992, Civil War II v1.1 
                is a later version of the Civil War II v1.0 variant. 
                The first time an infected program is executed, this virus 
                will install itself memory resident at the top of system 
                memory but below the 640K DOS boundary.  Total system and 
                available free memory, as indicated by the DOS CHKDSK 
                program, will have decreased by 1,024 bytes.  Interrupt 21 
                will be hooked by the virus in memory.  Once Civil War II 
                v1.1 is memory resident, it will infect .COM programs, 
                including COMMAND.COM, when they are executed or opened for 
                any reason.  Infected programs will have a file length 
                increase of 599 bytes with the virus being located at the 
                end of the file.  The file's date and time in the DOS disk 
                directory listing will not be altered.  The following text 
                strings are visible within the viral code in all infected 
                programs: 
                "Civil War II v1.1," 
                "(c) 06/03/1992 Trident/Dark Helmet, The Netherlands" 
                Origin: The Netherlands  November, 1992. 
       Civil War III v1.0: Received in March, 1993, Civil War III v1.0 
                is a later version of the Civil War virus described above. 
                The first time an infected program is executed, this virus 
                will install itself memory resident at the top of system 
                memory but below the 640K DOS boundary.  Total system and 
                available free memory, as indicated by the DOS CHKDSK 
                program, will have decreased by 1,200 bytes.  Interrupt 21 
                will be hooked by the virus in memory.  Once Civil War III 
                v1.0 is memory resident, it will infect .COM and .EXE 
                programs, including COMMAND.COM, when they are executed or 
                opened for any reason.  Infected programs will have a file 
                length increase of 901 bytes with the virus being located at 
                the end of the file.  The file's date and time in the DOS 
                disk directory listing will not be altered.  The following 
                text strings are visible within the viral code in all 
                infected programs: 
                "Civil War III v1.0," 
                "(c) Dec 1992, [ DH / TridenT ]" 
                Origin: The Netherlands  March, 1993. 
       Civil War.158: Received in January, 1995, Civil War.158 is a 248 
                byte variant of the Civil War virus.  It infects all of the 
                .COM files in the current directory when an infected program 
                is executed.  Infected programs increase in size by 248 bytes 
                with the virus being located at the end of the file.  The 
                programs date and time in the DOS disk directory listing 
                will have been updated to the current system date and time 
                when infection occurred.  The following text strings are 
                visible within the viral code: 
                "*.com" 
                "You're fucked" 
                Origin: Unknown  January, 1995. 
       Civil War-282: Received in January, 1994, Civil War-282 (or 
                Navigator) is a 282 byte variant of the Civil War virus. 
                Civil War-282 infects one .COM file in the current directory 
                each time an infected program is executed.  Infected programs 
                increase in size by 282 bytes with the virus being located 
                at the end of the file.  The program's date and time in the 
                DOS disk directory listing will not be altered.  The 
                following text strings are visible within the viral code in 
                all Civil War-282 infected programs: 
                "*.com" 
                "The Navigator, (c) 1992 Dark Helmet" 
                Origin:  Unknown  January, 1994. 
       Civil War-Lockjaw: Received in October, 1993, Civil War-Lockjaw is 
                based on the Proto-T variant described below.  Civil War- 
                Lockjaw installs itself memory resident at the top of system 
                memory but below the 640K DOS boundary when the first 
                infected program is executed.  Total system and available 
                free memory, as indicated by the DOS CHKDSK program, will 
                have decreased by 4,096 bytes.  Interrupt 21 will be hooked 
                by the virus in memory.  Once the virus is memory resident, 
                it will infect .COM programs, including COMMAND.COM, when 
                they are executed.  Infected programs will have a file length 
                increase of 1,053 bytes with the virus being located at the 
                end of the file.  The program's date and time in the DOS disk 
                directory listing will not be altered.  The following text 
                strings are visible within the viral code in all infected 
                programs: 
                "[l��k��W]" 
                "��k�d�M�" 
                "{p�Ŕ?-�]" 
                Execution of some utilities, including anti-viral utilities, 
                when the virus is memory resident will result in the program 
                being deleted and the display being altered similar to the 
                 Lokjaw  virus. 
                Origin:  Unknown  October, 1993. 
       Lockjaw.499: Received in January, 1995, Lockjaw.499 is based on 
                the Civil War-Lockjaw variant.  It  installs itself memory 
                resident at the top of system memory but below the 640K 
                DOS boundary when the first infected program is executed. 
                Total system and available free memory, as indicated by the 
                DOS CHKDSK program, will have decreased by 4,096 bytes. 
                Interrupt 21 will be hooked by the virus in memory.  Once 
                the virus is memory resident, it will infect .EXE programs 
                by creating a companion .COM file with the same base file 
                name.  These companion .COM files will have a file length 
                of 499 bytes with the current system date and time when 
                created.  The companion files will not be hidden in the 
                DOS disk directory listing.  The following text strings 
                can be found within the viral code contained in the 
                companion .COM files: 
                "Good Night" 
                "EXE COM" 
                "Temp" 
                Systems infected with the Lockjaw.499 virus can be manually 
                disinfected by deleting the 499 byte companion .COM files 
                which contain the viral code. 
                Origin:  Unknown  January, 1995. 
       Lockjaw.507: Received in January, 1995, Lockjaw.507 is based on 
                the Civil War-Lockjaw variant.  It  installs itself memory 
                resident at the top of system memory but below the 640K 
                DOS boundary when the first infected program is executed. 
                Total system and available free memory, as indicated by the 
                DOS CHKDSK program, will have decreased by 4,096 bytes. 
                Interrupt 21 will be hooked by the virus in memory.  Once 
                the virus is memory resident, it will infect .EXE programs 
                by creating a companion .COM file with the same base file 
                name.  These companion .COM files will have a file length 
                of 507 bytes with the current system date and time when 
                created.  The companion files will not be hidden in the 
                DOS disk directory listing.  The following text strings 
                can be found within the viral code contained in the 
                companion .COM files: 
                "Starry Night" 
                "EXE COM" 
                "Bornio Baby" 
                Systems infected with the Lockjaw.507 virus can be manually 
                disinfected by deleting the 507 byte companion .COM files 
                which contain the viral code. 
                Origin:  Unknown  January, 1995. 
       Proto-T: Received in November, 1992, Proto-T is based on the 
                Civil War virus described above, and appears to be an 
                earlier version of the Civil War II v1.1 virus described 
                above.  It does not match the description of the rumored 
                Proto-T virus which was circulated on BBSes starting in 
                October, 1992.  Proto-T installs itself memory resident at 
                the top of system memory but below the 640K DOS boundary 
                when the first infected program is executed.  Total system 
                and available free memory, as indicated by the DOS CHKDSK 
                program, will have decreased by 1,280 bytes.  Interrupt 21 
                will be hooked by Proto-T in memory.  Once Proto-T is 
                memory resident, it will infect .COM programs, including 
                COMMAND.COM, when they are executed.  Infected programs will 
                have a file length increase of 695 bytes with the virus 
                being located at the end of the file.  The program's date 
                and time in the DOS disk directory listing will not be 
                altered.  The following text strings are visible within the 
                viral code in all Proto-T infected programs: 
                "This program is sick." 
                "[PROTO-T by Dumbco, INC.] 
                Proto-T will sometimes access the system hard disk instead 
                of becoming memory resident when the first infected program 
                is executed.  Once this access ends, the system hard disk 
                will be inaccessible until the system is rebooted. 
                Origin:  Unknown  November, 1992. 
       Ritzen: Received in January, 1994, Ritzen is based on the Civil 
                War virus described above.  It installs itself memory 
                resident at the top of system memory but below the 640K 
                DOS boundary when the first infected program is executed. 
                Total system and available free memory, as indicated by the 
                DOS CHKDSK program, will have decreased by 1,536 bytes. 
                Interrupt 21 will be hooked by the virus in memory.  Once the 
                virus is memory resident, it will infect .COM and .EXE 
                programs, including COMMAND.COM, when they are executed. 
                Infected programs will have a file length increase of 1,087 
                bytes with the virus being located at the end of the file. 
                The program's date and time in the DOS disk directory listing 
                will have been updated to the current system date and time 
                when infection occurred.  The following text strings are 
                visible within the viral code in all infected programs: 
                "Dedicated to Ritzen, our Minister of Education and Science. 
                 We are getting sick of your budget cuts so we hope that you 
                 get sick of this virus.. (c) '93 by S.A.R. / TridenT" 
                Users of systems infected by the Ritzen virus may find that 
                the cursor becomes invisible on the system display, and that 
                some infected programs will fail to execute, displaying the 
                message: "Program too big to fit in memory". 
                The Ritzen variant is buggy, reinfecting memory each time 
                an infected program is executed.  As a result, the system 
                user will eventually not be able to run any programs since 
                very little memory will be available. 
                Origin:  Unknown  January, 1994.
