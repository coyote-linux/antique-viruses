 General Comments: 
       The AirCop virus was discovered in the State of Washington in the 
       United States in July, 1990.  Some early infections of this virus, 
       however, have been traced back to Taiwan, and Taiwan is probably 
       where it originated.  AirCop is a boot sector infector, and it will 
       only infect 360K 5.25" floppy diskettes. 
 
       When a system is booted from a diskette which is infected with the 
       AirCop virus, the virus will install itself memory resident.  The 
       AirCop virus installs itself memory resident at the top of high 
       system memory.  The system memory size and available free memory 
       will decrease by 1,024 bytes when the AirCop virus is memory 
       resident.  AirCop hooks interrupt 13. 
 
       Once AirCop is memory resident, any non-write protected diskettes 
       which are then accessed will have their boot sector infected with 
       the AirCop virus.  AirCop will copy the original disk boot sector to 
       sector 719 (Side 1, Cyl 39, Sector 9 on a normal 360K 5.25" 
       diskette) and then replace the boot sector at sector 0 with a copy 
       of the virus.  If a boot sector of a diskette infected with the 
       AirCop virus is viewed, it will be missing almost all of the 
       messages which normally appear in a normal boot sector.  The only 
       message remaining will be: 
 
               "Non-system..." 
 
       This will be located just before the end of the boot sector. 
 
       The AirCop virus will do one of two things on infected systems, 
       depending on how compatible the system's software and hardware is 
       with the virus.  On most systems, the virus will display the 
       following message at random intervals: 
 
               "Red State, Germ Offensive. 
                AIRCOP." 
 
       On other systems, the virus being present will result in the system 
       receiving a Stack Overflow Error and the system being halted.  In 
       this case, you must power off the system in order to be able to 
       reboot. 
 
       AirCop currently does not infect hard disk boot sectors or partition 
       tables. 
 
       AirCop can be removed from infected diskettes by first powering off 
       the system and rebooting from a known clean, write-protected DOS 
       master diskette.  The DOS SYS command should then be used to replace 
       the infected diskette's boot sector.  Alternately, MDisk can be used 
       following the power-down and reboot. 
 
       Known variant(s) of AirCop are: 
       AirCop-B: Submitted in May, 1991 from the United States, AirCop-B is 
                 a variant of the original AirCop virus.  Like the original 
                 virus, it only infects floppy disk boot sectors.  The 
                 Stack Overflow Error and system halt which occurred on 
                 some systems no longer occur with this variant.  AirCop-B 
                 activates during the month of September, and booting from 
                 an infected floppy will result in a flashing, scrolling 
                 display of the message: 
 
                         "This is Aircop" 
 
                 The boot will then proceed.  AirCop-B has also been 
                 altered to avoid detection by anti-viral utilities. 
                 Utilities which can detect AirCop may not be able to 
                 detect this variant.
