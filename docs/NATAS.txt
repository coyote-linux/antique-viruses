 General Comments: 
       The Natas or Natas.4746 virus was received in June, 1994.  It's 
       source code is rumored to have been distributed late last year in 
       an issue of 40-Hex magazine.  Natas is a memory resident stealth 
       virus which infects the system hard disk's Master Boot Record, 
       diskette boot sectors, .COM, .EXE, and overlay files, including 
       COMMAND.COM.  This virus is also highly polymorphic. 
 
       When the first Natas infected program is executed, this virus will 
       infect the hard disk master boot record (the sector containing the 
       hard disk partition table), as well the boot copy of COMMAND.COM. 
       Total system and available free memory, as indicated by the DOS CHKDSK 
       program, will have decreased by 5,664 bytes. 
 
       Once the Natas virus is memory resident, it will infect .COM, .EXE, 
       and overlay files when they are executed, opened, or copied.  Infected 
       programs will have a file length increase of 4,746 bytes, though the 
       file length increase will not be visible with the virus memory 
       resident.  The virus will be located at the end of all infected files, 
       although it will not be visible when the virus is memory resident as 
       Natas hides the infection.  The program's date and time in the DOS 
       disk directory listing will not be altered.  The following text string 
       is encrypted within the viral code in all Natas infected programs: 
 
               "Natas" 
 
       The DOS CHKDSK program will indicate Allocation Errors on all infected 
       files when the virus is memory resident.  System hangs may occur when 
       infected programs are executed. 
 
       The Natas virus is a destructive virus.  Each time an infected 
       program is executed, or the system is booted from an infected disk, 
       the virus has a 1-in-512 probability of overwriting a large 
       portion of the first system hard disk.  This event may also be 
       triggered by attempting to use a debugger to disassemble the virus. 
 
       Known variant(s) of Natas are: 
       Natas.4740: Received in July, 1995, this is a 4,740 byte variant 
               of the Natas virus described above.  Its size in memory is 
               6,144 bytes.  Natas.4740 adds 4,740 bytes to the files it 
               infects, though the virus hides the file length increase 
               when it is memory resident.  As with other variants of Natas, 
               this virus also infects the master boot record and diskette 
               boot sectors.  The following text string is encrypted within 
               the Natas.4740 viral code: 
               "Natas" 
               This variant adds 100 years the file date in the DOS disk 
               directory as an indicator that the file is infected. 
               Origin:  Unknown  July, 1995. 
       Natas.4744: Isolated in Spain, Natas.4744 is a 4,744 byte variant 
               of the Natas virus described above. 
               Origin:  Spain  July, 1994. 
       Natas.4774: Received in July, 1995, this is a 4,774 byte variant 
               of the Natas virus described above.  Its size in memory is 
               6,144 bytes.  Natas.4774 adds 4,774 bytes to the files it 
               infects, though the virus hides the file length increase 
               when it is memory resident.  As with other variants of Natas, 
               this virus also infects the master boot record and diskette 
               boot sectors.  The following text string is encrypted within 
               the Natas.4774 viral code: 
               "Time has come to pay (c)1994 NEVER-1 3" 
               This variant adds 100 years the file date in the DOS disk 
               directory as an indicator that the file is infected. 
               Origin:  Unknown  July, 1995. 
       Natas.4988: Isolated in the state of Arizona, in the 
               United States, in May, 1995, Natas.4988 is a 4,988 byte 
               variant of the Natas virus described above.  Its size in 
               memory is 6,144 bytes.  It adds 4,988 bytes to the files it 
               infects, though the virus hides the file length increase 
               when it is memory resident.  As with other variants of Natas, 
               this virus also infects the master boot record and diskette 
               boot sectors.  The following text strings are encrypted within 
               the Natas.4988 viral code: 
               "Time has come to pay (c)1994 NEVER-1 SANDRINE B." 
               "Yes I know my enemies 
                They're the teatchers who taught me to fight me 
                Compromise, conformity, assimilation, submission 
                Ignorance, hypocrisy, brutality, the elite 
                All of whitch are American dreams 
                (c) 1994 by Never-1(Belgium Most Hated) Sandrine B." 
                This variant of Natas adds 100 years to the file date in 
                the DOS disk directory, and some directory programs may 
                indicate a change in the year on infected files.  The 
                DOS CHKDSK program will not indicate file allocation 
                errors on infected files when this variant is memory 
                resident. 
                Origin:  United States  May, 1995.
