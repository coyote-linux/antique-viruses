 General Comments: 
       The Skism 1992 virus was isolated in the United States in January, 
       1992.  This virus is a non-resident overwriting virus which infects 
       .EXE programs. 
 
       When a program infected with Skism 1992 is executed, this virus 
       will look for an uninfected .EXE program to infect in the second 
       subdirectory from the current drive's root directory.  If an 
       uninfected .EXE program is not found, the virus will continue 
       reading down through the drives directory structure looking for 
       an uninfected .EXE program.  Once an uninfected .EXE program is 
       located, Skism 1992 will infect it, overwriting the first 1,992 
       bytes of the host file.  There will be no change to the file's 
       length unless it was originally smaller than 1,992 bytes, in 
       which case it will become 1,992 bytes in length.  The file's 
       date and time will not be altered. 
 
       Once Skism 1992 has completed infecting a file, it will return 
       the user to the DOS prompt.  The program the user was attempting 
       to execute will not function. 
 
       Skism 1992 contains the following text strings which are encrypted 
       within the viral code: 
 
               "The man who brought you" 
               "622, Skism One, Captain" 
               "Trips, and Sub-Zero now" 
               "shanks you again,  with" 
               "his latest..." 
               "Skism 1992 - Virus" 
               "Get a late pass!" 
               "* *.EXE" 
               "????????EXE" 
 
       It is unknown if Skism 1992 does anything besides replicate, 
       corrupting the files it infects. 
 
       Known variant(s) of Skism 1992 are: 
       Angel Dust 1.0: Based on the Skism 1992 virus, this virus infects 
                  one .EXE file in the current directory when an infected 
                  program is executed only if more than two subdirectories 
                  are present on the current drive.  Infected files will 
                  have the first 700 bytes overwritten.  The viral code 
                  contains the following encrypted text strings which are 
                  not visible in infected files: 
                  "* *.EXE *.* \" 
                  "ANGEL DUST V1.0" 
                  System hangs may occur when an infected program is 
                  executed.

       Skism 1992-B: Functionally equivalent to the original virus, 
                     this variant's encryption has been slightly 
                     modified. 
                     Origin:  United States  April, 1992. 
       Skism-808: Based on the Skism 1992 virus, this virus infects 
                  one .EXE file in the current directory when an infected 
                  program is executed only if more than two subdirectories 
                  are present on the current drive.  Infected files will 
                  have the first 808 bytes overwritten.  The viral code 
                  contains the following encrypted text strings which are 
                  not visible in infected files: 
                  "Skism Rythem Stack Virus-808." 
                  "Smart Kids Into Sick Methods" 
                  "Dont alter this code into your own strain, faggit." 
                  "HR/SSS NYCity, this is the fifth of many, many more...." 
                  "You sissys....." 
                  "* *.EXE *.*" 
                  "????????EXE" 
                  On the last Friday of any month, the virus will attempt 
                  to destroy all files in the current directory.
