 General Comments: 
       The Enigma virus was submitted in February, 1991, by Alberto Colusa 
       of Italy.  This virus is a non-resident infector of .EXE files.  The 
       original submitted sample of this virus was not a natural infection 
       of the virus, being on a .COM file, so the virus may actually be a 
       research virus. 
 
       When a program infected with Enigma is executed, one .EXE program in 
       the current directory will be infected by the virus.  Infected .EXE 
       programs will increase in length by 1,755 bytes.  The virus will be 
       located at the end of infected programs.  Infected programs will 
       also contain the following text strings: 
 
               "This is the voice of the Enigma virus...... 
                the spirits of the hell are coming back!" 
               "(C) 1991 by Cracker Jack * Italy * *.exe" 
               "newenigmavir" 
 
       It is not known if Enigma does anything besides replicate.
