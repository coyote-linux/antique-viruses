 General Comments: 
       The dBASE virus was discovered by Ross Greenberg of New York. This 
       virus infects .COM & .OVL files, and will corrupt data in DBF files 
       by randomly transposing bytes in any open .DBF file. It keeps track 
       of which files and bytes were transposed in a hidden file (BUG.DAT) 
       in the same directory as the .DBF file(s). The virus restores these 
       bytes if the file is read, so it appears that nothing is wrong. 
       Once the BUG.DAT file is 90 days old or more, the virus will 
       overwrite the FAT and root directory on the disk. 
 
       After this virus has been detected, if you remove the infected 
       dBASE program and replace it with a clean copy, your .DBF files 
       that were opened during the period that you were infected will be 
       useless since they are garbled on the disk even though they would 
       be displayed as expected by the infected dBASE program.
