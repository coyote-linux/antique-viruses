 General Comments: 
       The HH&H virus was submitted in April, 1992.  Its origin is 
       unknown.  HH&H is a memory resident infector of .COM programs, 
       including COMMAND.COM. 
 
       When the first HH&H infected program is executed, the HH&H virus 
       will install itself memory resident at the top of system memory 
       but below the 640K DOS boundary.  Total system and available free 
       memory, as indicated by the DOS CHKDSK program, will have decreased 
       by 6,144 bytes.  Interrupts 1C and 21 will be hooked by HH&H in 
       memory. 
 
       Once the HH&H virus is memory resident, it will infect .COM 
       programs over approximately 8K in size when they are executed. 
       If COMMAND.COM is executed, it will become infected.  Programs 
       infected with the HH&H virus will have a file length increase of 
       4,091 bytes.  The virus will be located at the end of the 
       program.  The file's date and time in the DOS disk directory 
       listing will have been updated to the current system date and time 
       when infection occurred. 
 
       The following text strings are encrypted within the HH&H virus' 
       code, and hence are not visible in infected files: 
 
               "HARD HIT & HEAVY HATE the HUMANS!!" 
               "[ H.H.& H.H. ]" 
 
       It is unknown what HH&H does besides replicate.
