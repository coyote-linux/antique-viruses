;	Virus school, lession 1	 	(c) 1992 Tormentor [Demoralized Youth]
;
;	This is the first lession on how to make an own virus.
;	Hope you'll learn something of it...
;	To be compiled with TASM 3.0 or higher.
;
;	This virus is quite dumb and 'noisy' 
;	It updates the filedate and time, changes DTA before execution causing
;	some progs to belive they are executed with parameters...
;	But this should only be a 'raw' virus that you can develop.
;	Certain program may hang, so i recommend you not to spread to geeks
;	since there is MANY better viruses to use for such nice purpose.
;
;	If you want to conntact me or other virus-writers call me on my board:
