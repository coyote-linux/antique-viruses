 General Comments: 
       The V2P2 virus is a research virus written by Mark Washburn and 
       distributed to some anti-viral program authors in June of 1990. 
       This virus, according to its author, has not been released.  This 
       virus is a non-resident generic infector of .COM files. 
 
       When a program infected with the V2P2 virus is executed, it will 
       infect the first .COM file it finds in the current directory which 
       is not infected with the virus.  The virus adds its code to the end 
       of the file, and the infected file's length will increase between 
       1,426 and 2,157 bytes. 
 
       Like the 1260 virus, this virus uses a complex encryption method. 
       In fact, the encryption used with the 1260 virus is one of several 
       possible encryptions that V2P2 may produce.  As a result, virus 
       scanning software will often identify the 1260 virus in a file as 
       being both 1260 and V2P2.  This identification is entirely valid as 
       1260 is a special case of V2P2.
