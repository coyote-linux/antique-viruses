 General Comments: 
       The Keypress virus was reported and isolated in many locations in 
       the United States in late October, 1990.  This virus is a memory 
       resident infector of .COM and .EXE files, including COMMAND.COM. 
 
       The first time a program infected with the Keypress virus is 
       executed, the virus will install itself memory resident at the 
       top of free available memory, but below the 640K DOS boundary. 
       Interrupts 1C and 21 will be hooked by the virus.  Available free 
       memory on the system will have decreased by 1,232 bytes. 
 
       After the virus is memory resident, any file executed may become 
       infected by the virus.  In the case of .COM files, they are only 
       infected if their original file length was greater than 1,232 bytes. 
       .EXE files of any length will be infected, as will COMMAND.COM if 
       it is executed.  Infected programs will have their directory 
       date/time changed to the system date and time when they were 
       infected by this virus.  .COM files will increase in length by 
       between 1,234 and 1,248 bytes upon infection.  .EXE files will 
       increase by 1,472 to 1,486 bytes upon infection.  In either case, 
       the virus will be located at the end of the infected file. 
 
       The Keypress virus activates after being memory resident for 30 
       minutes.  Upon activation, the virus may interfere with keyboard 
       input by repeating keystrokes.  For example, if "a" is entered on 
       the keyboard, it may be changed to "aaaaaa" by the virus. 
 
       Infected files can be identified by containing the following hex 
       string near the end of the infected program: 4333C98E1E2901CD21. 
 
       Known variant(s) of Keypress are: 
       Keypress-1232X: Keypress-1232X is a modified version of the 
              Keypress virus and is functionally similar to the original 
              virus.  It contains the following text string: 
              ".COM .EXE" 
              Origin:  Unknown  February, 1994. 
       Keypress-1238: Keypress-1238 is a modified version of the 
              Keypress virus which at the time of its submission was 
              undetectable by anti-viral scanning programs.  Its size in 
              memory is 1,328 bytes, hooking interrupts 1C and 21.  It adds 
              1,238 to 1,252 bytes to the .COM programs it infects, and 
              1,492 to 1,506 bytes to .EXE programs.  In both cases, the 
              virus will be located at the end of the file, and the file's 
              date and time in the DOS disk directory will have been updated 
              to the current system date and time. 
              Origin:  Unknown  September, 1992. 
       Keypress-1238B: Functionally equivalent to Keypress-1238, this

              displayed message, and system hangs do not occur. 
              Origin:  Italy  June, 1992. 
       Peach: Based on the original Keypress virus, this variant from 
              Singapore is much smaller in size.  When Peach is memory 
              resident, it will decrease total system and available free 
              memory by 896 bytes. Only interrupt 21 will be hooked.

              "2 Peach GargenMeyer Rd. Spore 1543" 
              "chklist.cps" 
              This variant does not appear to interfer with keyboard input 
              as other of the Keypress group do.  It is targetted at 
              Central Point Anti-Virus, looking for the CHKLIST.CPS file 
              created by the Central Point package. 
              Origin:  Singapore  January, 1992.  Isolated: United States 
       SamSoft: Similar to the original Keypress, this variant adds 
              1,232 - 1,248 bytes to the .COM files it infects, and 
              1,472 - 1,487 bytes to .EXE files.  The file's date and time 
              in the DOS disk directory will have been updated to the 
              current system date and time.  Unlike the original 
              virus, it does not repeat characters entered on the system 
              keyboard.  It contains one text string: ".COM .EXE". 
              Origin:  Unknown  May, 1992.

              some minor alterations. 
              Origin:  Unknown  July, 1992. 
       St Leos: Similar to the original Keypress, this variant is 
              functionally equivalent.  It has been slightly altered. 
              Origin:  Unknown  January, 1992. 
       Turku: Similar to the original Keypress variant, Turku adds 
              1,234 to 1,247 bytes to the .COM files it infects.  .EXE 
              files increase in size by 1,472 to 1,486 bytes.  The following 
              text string will be found in the viral code of all infected 
              files: ".COM .EXE".  The sticky key or repeated keystroke 
              effect in the original virus has been replaced by a series of 
              beeps being emitted on they system speaker, the system being 
              halted, and the following message being displayed: 
              "Internal stack overflow 
               System halted" 
              Once this message appears, the system must be powered off to 
              be rebooted. 
              Origin:  Unknown  January, 1992.
