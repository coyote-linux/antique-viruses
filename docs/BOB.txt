 General Comments: 
       The Bob virus was submitted in February, 1992.  Its origin, or 
       point of isolation, are unknown.  Bob is a non-resident, direct 
       action infector of .COM programs, including COMMAND.COM. 
 
       When a program infected with the Bob virus is executed, this virus 
       will infect all the previously uninfected .COM programs located 
       in the current directory of the current drive.  Infected programs 
       will usually have a file length increase of 718 bytes, though if 
       the file's original length was less than 698 bytes, its length 
       will become 1,416 bytes.  The virus will be located at the beginning 
       of the program.  The file's date and time in the DOS disk directory 
       listing will not be altered. 
 
       The following text strings can be found in all Bob infected 
       programs: 
 
               "*. *.COM" 
               "COMMAND.COM MKS_VIR.COM" 
               "Program terminated normally" 
 
       It is unknown if the Bob virus does anything besides replicate.
