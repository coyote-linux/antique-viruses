 General Comments: 
       The Joker virus was isolated in Poland in December, 1989. This virus 
       is a generic .EXE file infector, and is a poor replicator (i.e., it 
       does not quickly infect other files). 
 
       Programs which are infected with the Joker virus will display bogus 
       error messages and comments.  These messages and comments can be 
       found in the infected files at the beginning of the viral code. 
       Here are some of the messages and comments that may be displayed: 
 
       "Incorrect DOS version" 
       "Invalid Volume ID Format failure" 
       "Please put a new disk into drive A:" 
       "End of input file" 
       "END OF WORKTIME.  TURN SYSTEM OFF!" 
       "Divide Overflow" 
       "Water detect in Co-processor" 
       "I am hungry! Insert HAMBURGER into drive A:" 
       "NO SMOKING, PLEASE!" 
       " Thanks." 
       "Don't beat me !!" 
       "Don't drink and drive." 
       "Another cup of cofee ?" 
       " OH, YES!" 
       "Hard Disk head has been destroyed. Can you borow me your one?" 
       "Missing light magenta ribbon in printer!" 
       "In case mistake, call GHOST BUSTERS" 
       "Insert tractor toilet paper into printer." 
 
       This virus may also alter .DBF files, adding messages to them.
