;This is a simple boot sector that will load either MS-DOS or PC-DOS. It is not
;self-reproducing, but it will be used as the foundation on which to build a
;virus into a boot sector.

;This segment is where the first operating system file (IBMBIO.COM or IO.SYS)
;will be loaded and executed from. We don't know (or care) what is there, but
;we do need the address to jump to defined in a separate segment so we can
;execute a far jump to it.
