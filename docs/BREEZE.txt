 General Comments: 
       The Breeze virus was submitted in December, 1992, and is originally 
       from The Netherlands.  Breeze is a non-resident, direct action 
       infector of .COM programs, including COMMAND.COM.  It is written by 
       the same author as the  Deicide  family of viruses. 
 
       When a program infected with the Breeze virus is executed, the 
       Breeze virus will infect one .COM program located in the current 
       directory.  If COMMAND.COM is located in this directory, it may 
       become infected.  Programs infected with the Breeze virus will have 
       a file length increase of 358 bytes with the virus being located at 
       the beginning of the file.  The program's date and time in the 
       DOS disk directory listing will not be altered.  The following text 
       strings can be found within the viral code in all Breeze infected 
       programs: 
 
               "Dutch [Breeze] by Glenn Benton" 
               "*.COM" 
 
       Breeze doesn't appear to do anything besides replicate.
