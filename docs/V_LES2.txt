;	Virus Lession #2 	'How to make a non-resident EXE infector'
;
;	(c) 1992 Tormentor // Demoralized Youth
;
;	Well, I had not time to comment this code as much as I wanted to,
;	but here you are.
; 	What can be hard to understand is the .EXE header changes, but if
;	you look at the description on the header (ex: Norton guide Tech. Ref)
;	you'll understand...
;	Anyway, feel free to use this example and if you have any questions
;	or anything call my board: Swedish Virus Labratory +46-3191-9393

;	Greetings to all virus-writers!
