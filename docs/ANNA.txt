 General Comments: 
       The Anna virus was received from Manchester, England in October, 
       1992.  Anna is a non-resident, direct action infector of .COM 
       programs, including COMMAND.COM. 
 
       When a program infected with the Anna virus is executed, the Anna 
       virus will infect one .COM program located in the current directory. 
       Infected programs will have a file length increase of 742 bytes with 
       the virus being located at the end of the file.  The program's date 
       and time in the DOS disk directory listing will have been updated to 
       the current system date and time when infection occurred.  The 
       following text strings are encrypted within the viral code: 
 
               "[ANNA] Slartibartfast, ARCV NuKE the French" 
               "Have a Cool Yule from the ARcV"
