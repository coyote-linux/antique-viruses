 General Comments: 
       The 405 virus is an overwriting virus which infects only .COM files 
       in the C: drive root directory.  If the length of the .COM file was 
       originally less than 405 bytes, the resulting infected file will 
       have a length of 405 bytes.  This virus currently cannot recognize 
       .COM files that are already infected, so it will attempt to infect 
       them again. 
 
       The 405 virus doesn't carry an activation date, and doesn't do 
       anything but replicate in the C: drive root directory.  However, 
       since it overwrites the first 405 bytes of .COM files, infected 
       files are not recoverable except by replacing them from uninfected 
       backups or master distribution disks. 
 
       Known variants of 405 are: 
       405-EST: Submitted in August, 1991, 405-EST is an altered 
                version of the 405 virus.  The purpose of the alteration 
                is to avoid detection by some anti-viral programs.
