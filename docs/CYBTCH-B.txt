 General Comments: 
       The CyberTech, or CyberTech-A, virus was submitted in December, 1992. 
       The origin of this virus appears to be The Netherlands.  CyberTech 
       is a non-resident direct action infector of .COM programs, including 
       COMMAND.COM. 
 
       When a program infected with the CyberTech virus is executed, the 
       CyberTech virus will infect one .COM program located in the current 
       directory.  Infected programs will have a file length increase of 
       1,066 or 1,076 bytes, with the virus being located at the end of the 
       file.  Programs which have increased in size by 1,066 bytes will have 
       had 10 bytes of validation information added by the ViruScan program 
       removed.  The program's date and time in the DOS disk directory 
       listing will not have been altered. 
 
       The CyberTech virus will occassionally display the following message 
       when an infected program is executed: 
 
               "CyberTech Virus - Strain A 
                (C) 1992 John Tardy of Trident" 
 
       After December 31, 1992, the virus will display the following 
       message and disinfect the file the user is executing each time an 
       infected program is executed: 
 
               "The previous year you have been infected by a virus 
                without knowing or removing it. To be gentle to you 
                I decide to remove myself from your system. I suggest 
                you better buy ViruScan of McAfee to ensure yourself 
                complete security of your precious data. Next time you 
                could be infected with a malevolent virus. 
                May I say goodbye to you now...." 
 
       All of the above text is encrypted within the virus, as is the 
       following additional text strings: 
 
               "chklist.cps" 
               "*.COM" 
 
       CyberTech may also interfer with the functioning of the Central 
       Point Anti-Virus program. 
 
       Known variant(s) of CyberTech are: 
       CyberTech-222: Based on the CyberTech virus described above, 
                    this variant also infects one .COM program each time 
                    an infected program is executed.  Infected programs 
                    will have a file length increase of 222 bytes with the 
                    virus being located at the end of the file.  The file's 
                    date and time in the DOS disk directory listing will 
                    not be altered.  One tech string is visible within the 
                    viral code: 
                    "*.COM" 
                    Origin:  The Netherlands  June, 1993. 
       CyberTech-501: Also known as Ice Cream, CyberTech-501 infects one 
                    .COM program in the current directory each time an 
                    infected program is executed.  Infected programs will 
                    have a file length increase of 501 bytes with the 
                    virus being located at the end of the file.  The file's 
                    date and time in the DOS disk directory listing will 
                    not be altered, though the seconds field will have been 
                    set to "02".  The following text strings are encrypted 
                    within the CyberTech-501 viral code: 
                    "I scream, you scream, we both scream for an ice-cream!" 
                    "John Tardy" 
                    "*.COM" 
                    Origin:  The Netherlands  October, 1993. 
       CyberTech.552: CyberTech.552 infects one .COM program in the 
                    current directory each time an infected program is 
                    executed.  Infected programs will have a file length 
                    increase of 552 bytes with the virus being located at 
                    the end of the file.  The file's date and time in the 
                    DOS disk directory listing will not be altered, though 
                    the seconds field will have been set to "02".  The 
                    following text strings are encrypted within the 
                    CyberTech.552 viral code: 
                    "Mourners of a dying world" 
                    "Too late to reconcile" 
                    "Into Everlasting Fire" 
                    "Can't you see it's Satan's world" 
                    "TRIDENT" 
                    "John Tardy" 
                    "*.COM" 
                    Origin:  Unknown  July, 1994. 
       CyberTech-654: CyberTech-654 infects one .COM program in the 
                    current directory each time an infected program is 
                    executed.  Infected programs will have a file length 
                    increase of 654 bytes with the virus being located at 
                    the end of the file.  The file's date and time in the 
                    DOS disk directory listing will not be altered, though 
                    the seconds field will have been set to "02".  The 
                    following text strings are encrypted within the 
                    CyberTech-654 viral code: 
                    "(C) 1992 John Tardy / Trident" 
                    "Satan Spawn, the Caco-Daemon - Mor(T)alities Death" 
                    "*.COM" 
                    Origin:  The Netherlands  January, 1994. 
       CyberTech-B: Based on the CyberTech virus described above, this 
                    variant adds 1,205 or 1,215 bytes to the .COM programs 
                    it infects, with the exception of COMMAND.COM.  In the 
                    case of COMMAND.COM, it will overwrite part of the slack 
                    (hex 00) area in the file so there will be no file 
                    length increase.  It occassionally displays the 
                    following message when an infected program is executed: 
                    "CyberTech Virus - Strain B 
                     (C) 1992 John Tardy of Trident" 
                    The virus activates after December 31, 1993, when it 
                    will display the same message as the original virus 
                    and disinfect the program the user is executing. 
                    Origin:  The Netherlands  December 1992. 
       CyberTech.1078: Received in January, 1996, this is a 1,078 byte 
                    variant of the CyberTech virus described above.  It adds 
                    1,078 bytes to the .COM files it infects, the virus 
                    being located at the end of the file.  The file's date 
                    and time in the DOS disk directory listing will not be 
                    alterer.  The following text strings are encrypted 
                    within the viral code: 
                    "The previous year you have been infected by a virus" 
                    "without knowing or removing it. To be gentle to you" 
                    "I decide to remove myself from your system. I suggest" 
                    "you better buy ViruScan of McAfee to ensure yourself" 
                    "complete security of your precious data. Next time your" 
                    "could be infected with a malevolent virus. " 
                    "May I say goodbye to you now...." 
                    "CyberTech Virus - Strain A" 
                    "(C) 1992 John Tardy of Trident" 
                    "chklist.cps" 
                    "*.COM" 
                    Origin:  The Netherlands  January 1996.
