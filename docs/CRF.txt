 General Comments: 
       The CRF virus was submitted in November, 1991.  Its origin and point 
       of original discovery are unknown.  CRF is a non-resident, direct 
       action infector of .COM files, including COMMAND.COM. 
 
       When a program infected with the CRF virus is executed, the virus 
       will infect all previously uninfected .COM files in the current 
       drive and directory.  If COMMAND.COM is located in this directory, 
       it will be infected.  Infected .COM files increase in size by 270 
       bytes with the virus being located at the end of the infected 
       program.  The file's date and time in the DOS disk directory will 
       have been updated to the system date and time when infection 
       occurred.  Two text strings are visible within the virus in 
       infected files:  "OZR3" and "*.COM". 
 
       It is unknown if CRF does anything besides replicate.
