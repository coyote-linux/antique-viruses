 General Comments: 
       The VirDem virus was written in 1986-1987 by Ralf Burger of 
       Germany. The virus was originally distributed in Europe as a 
       demonstration virus, to assist computer users in understanding 
       how a computer virus operates. 
 
       The VirDem virus is not memory resident, and only infects .COM 
       files on the A: drive.  It will always skip the first .COM file in 
       the root directory, so normally it will not infect COMMAND.COM.  It 
       will also not infect .COM files past the second subdirectory on the 
       disk. 
 
       Infected files that were originally less than approximately 1,500 
       bytes will be 2,616 bytes after infection.  .COM files which were 
       greater than 1,500 bytes will increase in size by approximately 
       1,236 bytes. 
 
       When an infected program is executed, VirDem will infect the next 
       candidate .COM file.  Infected files will contain the viral code, 
       followed by the original program.  After infecting the .COM file, 
       the virus will play a "game" with you, starting with the following 
       text being displayed: 
 
              " VirDem Ver.: 1.06 (Generation #) aktive.

                This is a demoprogram for 
                computerviruses. Please put in a 
                number now. 
                If you're right, you'll be 
                able to continue. 
                The number is between 
                0 and #                                         " 
 
               (Note: I have removed the phone number here, but it 
                appears where xxxxx/xxxx is above.  Where # is, the 
                virus's generation number appears.) 
 
       At this point, you must guess the correct number and enter it.  If 
       you put in the wrong number, you get the following message and your 
       program is not run: 
 
              " Sorry, you're wrong 
 
                More luck at next try ....    " 
 
       If you guess the correct number, you receive the following message 
       and your program then executes: 
 
              " Famous. You're right. 
                You'll be able to continue.  " 
 
       Finally, after all the candidate .COM files on the A: drive are 
       infected, the following message is displayed: 
 
              " All your programs are 
                struck by VIRDEM.COM now." 
 
       VIRDEM.COM was the original distribution file containing the virus, 
       and had a VIRDEM.DOC file included with it.  VirDem is not 
       widespread, and is not destructive. 
 
       Known variant(s) of VirDem are: 
       VirDem 2: Similar to the virus described above, the major 
                 difference is that the text messages have been translated 
                 to German. 
       VirDem-833: Based on the VirDem virus described above, VirDem-833 
                 infects one .COM file in the current directory when an 
                 infected program is executed.  Infected programs will have 
                 a file length increase of 833 bytes with the virus being 
                 located at the beginning of the file.  The program's date 
                 and time in the DOS disk directory listing will not be 
                 altered.  The following text strings are visible within the 
                 VirDem-833 viral code: 
                 "\ * *.COM" 
                 "\ IRUS S" 
                 VirDem-833 activates when an infected program is executed 
                 on any Monday starting in 1993.  At this time, a "bug" 
                 will traverse the top of the system display from left to 
                 right, and the current drive's file allocation table may 
                 be corrupted by the virus. 
                 Origin:  Unknown  January 1993.
