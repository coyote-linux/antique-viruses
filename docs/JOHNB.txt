 General Comments: 
       The Joshua virus was submitted in October, 1992.  Its origin or 
       point of isolation is unknown.  Joshua is a non-resident, direct 
       action infector of .COM and .EXE programs, but not COMMAND.COM. 
 
       When a program infected with the Joshua virus is executed, this 
       virus will infect two programs in the current directory.  It 
       prefers .EXE programs to .COM programs.  If it could not infect 
       two programs in the current directory, it will move upwards in 
       the directory structure looking for programs to infect. 
 
       Programs infected with the Joshua virus will have a file length 
       increase of 965 bytes with the virus being located at the end of 
       the file.  The program's date and time in the DOS disk directory 
       listing will not be altered. 
 
       Occassionally, the Joshua virus will display the following message 
       when an infected program is executed: 
 
               "�����������������������������������������������ķ 
                � Guess what ???                                � 
                � You have been victimized by a virus!!! Do not � 
                � try to reboot your computer or even turn it   � 
                � off.  You might as well read this and weep!   � 
                �����������������������������������������������Ľ"
