 General Comments: 
       The V2P6 virus is a research virus written by Mark Washburn and 
       distributed to some anti-viral program authors in July of 1990. 
       This virus, according to its author, has not been released.  This 
       virus is a non-resident generic infector of .COM files similar to 
       the 1260 and V2P2 viruses.         
 
       When a program infected with the V2P6 virus is executed, it will 
       infect the first .COM file it finds in the current directory which 
       is not infected with the virus.  The virus adds its code to the end 
       of the file, and the infected file's length will increase between 
       1,946 and 2,111 bytes. 
 
       Like the 1260 and other viruses by Mark Washburn, this virus uses a 
       complex encryption method.  The encryption method used by V2P6 is 
       more complex than that used in V2P2, but less complex than that 
       used in the last known variant in this family, V2P6Z.  Like V2P2, an 
       algorithmic approach must be used to identify this virus. 
 
       Known variant(s) of V2P6 are: 
       V2P6-B: Similar to V2P6 in behavior, programs infected with this 
               variant will increase in size by 1,990 to 2,261 bytes. 
       V2P6Z: Similar to V2P6 in behavior, this variant is the last 
              variant in this family to be received by researchers.  It 
              employs a more complex encryption algorithm requiring an 
              algorithmic search to identify infected files.  V2P6Z adds 
              2,076 to 2,364 bytes to the .COM programs it infects. 
              Origin:  United States  August, 1990.
