 General Comments: 
       The USSR 711 virus was submitted in December, 1990, and comes from 
       the USSR.  This virus is a memory resident infector of .COM files. 
       It does not infect COMMAND.COM. 
 
       When the first program infected with USSR 711 is executed, the 
       virus will install itself memory resident at the top of system 
       memory but below the 640K DOS boundary.  This memory is reserved. 
       The virus also hooks interrupts 08, 13, and 21.  The DOS CHKDSK 
       program will indicate that total system memory and available free 
       memory is 704 bytes less than what the user expects.  The interrupt 
       12 return is not altered by this virus. 
 
       After USSR 711 is memory resident, any .COM file which is executed 
       that had an original file length of at least 1600 bytes will be 
       infected by the virus.  Infected .COM files will increase in size 
       by 704 to 719 bytes, and the virus will be located at the end of 
       the infected file. 
 
       Systems infected with USSR 711 may notice occasional system hangs 
       which may occur when this virus attempts to infect .COM programs. 
 
       It is unknown if USSR 711 does anything besides replicate and 
       occasionally hang the system when infecting files.
