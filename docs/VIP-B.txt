 General Comments: 
       The Viperize virus was submitted in April, 1992.  Its origin is 
       unknown.  Viperize is a non-resident direct action infector of 
       .COM programs, including COMMAND.COM.  It is based on the Vienna 
       virus. 
 
       When a program infected with Viperize is executed, the Viperize 
       virus will infect one .COM program located in the current 
       directory.  Infected programs will have a file length increase of 
       934 bytes with the virus being located at the end of the file. 
       The seconds in the program's timestamp in the disk directory will 
       have been set to 62.  The following text strings can be found within 
       the Viperize viral code in infected programs: 
 
               "*.COM" 
               "PATH=" 
               "????????COM" 
 
       Viperize activates on a random basis, at which time it will 
       display the following message: 
 
               "THE VIPERIZE VIRUS STRAIN A 
                (c) 1992, STINGRAY / VIPER 
                WITH AFFECTION TO BRENDA M.G. 
                ONE OF THESE DAYS, YOU'LL BE MINE! 
                AND -YOU- WILL FRY. FUCK YOU MCAFEEE." 
 
       The virus may also corrupt the current drive's file allocation 
       table and hang the system when the message is displayed. 
 
       Known variant(s) of Viperize are: 
       Viperize-B: Functionally similar to the original virus, this 
                   variant has two bytes which have been altered. 
                   Origin:  Unknown  July, 1992.
