 General Comments: 
       The Burger, or 909090h, virus was written and copyrighted in 1986 by 
       Ralf Burger of West Germany.  This virus is extinct in the "public 
       domain".  This virus is a non-resident overwriting virus, infecting 
       .COM and .EXE files, including COMMAND.COM. 
 
       When a program infected with the Burger virus is executed, the virus 
       will attempt to infect one previously uninfected .COM file located 
       in the C: drive root directory.  To determine if the program was 
       previously infected, the virus checks to see if the first three 
       bytes of the .COM file are three NOP instructions (909090h).  If the 
       first three bytes are the NOP instructions, the virus goes on 
       checking until it finds an uninfected .COM file.  If no uninfected 
       .COM file exists, the virus then renames all the .EXE files in the 
       root directory to .COM files and checks those files.  Once it finds 
       a .COM file to infect, it overwrites the first 560 bytes of the 
       uninfected program with the virus code.  At this point, the program 
       the user was attempting to run will either end or hang the system. 
       Infected programs will never execute properly as the first portion 
       of the program has been destroyed.  Systems which have been infected 
       with the Burger virus will fail to boot once the virus has infected 
       the hard disk boot partition's COMMAND.COM, or the copy of 
       COMMAND.COM on their boot diskette.  Infected files can be easily 
       identified by the "909090B8000026A245" hex sequence located in the 
       first nine bytes of all infected files.  Infected files cannot be 
       disinfected, they must be replaced from a clean source. 
 
       Known variant(s) of Burger are: 
       404: Similar to the Burger virus, this variant's actual code length 
            is 404 bytes, though the first 560 bytes of infected files will 
            be overwritten.  Infected files will have their first nine 
            bytes contain the hex string: "909090B8000026A245". 
       505: Similar to the Burger virus, this variant's actual code length 
            is 505 bytes, though the first 560 bytes of infected files will 
            be overwritten.  Infected files will have their first nine 
            bytes contain the hex string: "909090B8000026A3A0". 
       509: Similar to the Burger virus, this variant's actual code length 
            is 509 bytes, though the first 560 bytes of infected files will 
            be overwritten.  Infected files will have their first nine 
            bytes contain the hex string: "909090B8000026A3A4". 
       540: Similar to the Burger virus, this variant's actual code length 
            is 540 bytes, though the first 560 bytes of infected files will 
            be overwritten.  Infected files will have their first nine 
            bytes contain the hex string: "909090B8000026A3A3". 
       541: Similar to the Burger virus, this variant overwrites the first 
            560 bytes of infected programs, though the virus's length is 
            actually 541 bytes.  Infected programs will start with the hex 
            sequence: "909090B8000026A3A4". 
       542: Similar to the Burger virus, this variant overwrites the first 
            560 bytes of infected programs, though the virus's length is 
            actually 542 bytes.  Infected programs will start with the hex 
            sequence: "909090B8000026A3A5". 
       560-B: Similar to the Burger virus, this variant overwrites the 
              first 560 bytes of infected programs, and the virus's length 
              is 560 bytes.  The end of the virus code contains the following 
              text: "his file was downloaded from the Vir".  This text will 
              appear in all replicated samples.  Infected programs will start 
              with the hex string: "909090B8000026A3B2". 
       CIA: Discovered in the United States in October, 1990, this virus is 
            similar to the Burger virus described above.  The first nine 
            bytes of all infected files in hex will be: 
            "909090B8000026A3A5".   The actual length of this variant is 
            541 bytes, though the first 560 bytes of infected programs are 
            overwritten. 
       CIA-2: Isolated in May, 1992, this variant is a minor variant of 
            the CIA variant described above.
