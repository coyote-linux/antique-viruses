 General Comments: 
       The USSR 516 virus was submitted in December, 1990.  It is from the 
       USSR.  This virus is a memory resident infector of .COM programs, 
       including COMMAND.COM.  It infects on file execution. 
 
       The first time a program infected with the USSR 516 virus is 
       executed, the virus will install itself memory resident in a "hole 
       in memory" between MSDOS and the DOS Stacks.  This area will be 
       labeled DOS Data.  Interrupt 21 will be hooked by the virus.  There 
       will be no change in total system memory or available free memory. 
 
       After the virus is memory resident, it will infect .COM programs 
       which are executed that had an uninfected file length which was 
       greater than 512 bytes.  Infected .COM programs will have their 
       length increased by 516 bytes, the virus will be located at the end 
       of the program. 
 
       USSR 516 does not appear to do anything besides replicate.  The 
       original submitted sample was not a natural infection of this 
       virus, so this may be a research virus.
