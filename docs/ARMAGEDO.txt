 General Comments: 
       The Armagedon virus was isolated on June 2, 1990, by George 
       Spiliotis of Athens, Greece.  Armagedon is a memory resident virus 
       which infects .COM files, increasing their length by 1,079 bytes. 
       The virus will be located at the beginning of infected files. 
 
       The first time an infected program is executed on a system, the 
       virus installs itself memory resident as a low system memory TSR 
       of 1,392 bytes, hooking interrupts 8 and 21.  Any .COM files which 
       are later executed are then infected by the resident virus. 
 
       Infected systems will experience the text string "Armagedon the 
       GREEK" being sent to COM ports 1 - 4 at timed intervals.  Between 
       5:00 and 7:00, the virus will attempt to use the system's COM ports 
       to make a phone call to Local Time Information in Crete, Greece.  If 
       a connection is made, the phone line will remain open until the user 
       notices that the phone line is in use.  (Needless to say, this 
       doesn't work if the system is located outside of Greece as dialing 
       codes are considerably different between countries.) 
 
       This virus otherwise is not destructive. 
 
       Known variant(s) of Armagedon are: 
       Armagedon #911: Based on the original Armagedon virus, this 
                       variant also adds 1,079 bytes to the .COM programs 
                       it infects.  The phone number called by the virus 
                       has been changed to "911", which is the police and 
                       emergency services phone number implemented in 
                       much of the United States.  The text string which 
                       is sent to the COM ports has been changed to 
                       "Support Your Police". 
                       Origin:  United States, September, 1992. 
       Armagedon.1065: Received in January, 1996, this variant adds 
                       1,065 bytes to the .COM files it infects.  Its 
                       memory resident TSR is 1,392 bytes, hooking 
                       interrupts 08 and 21.  The following text strings 
                       are visible within the viral code: 
                       "COM" 
                       "+++aTh0m0s7=35dp081,,,,141" 
                       "Armagedon the GReEK" 
                       Origin:  Unknown, January 1996 
       Armagedon.1066: Received in January, 1996, this variant adds 
                       1,066 bytes to the .COM files it infects.  Its 
                       memory resident TSR is 1,392 bytes, hooking 
                       interrupts 08 and 21.  The following text strings 
                       are visible within the viral code: 
                       "COM" 
                       "+++aTh0m0s7=35dp081,,,,141" 
                       "Armagedon the GREEK" 
                       Origin:  Unknown, January 1996 
       Armagedon-1074: Similar to the original Armagedon, this variant 
                       adds 1,074 bytes to infected files.  Its memory 
                       resident TSR is 1,408 bytes in length, and hooks 
                       interrupts 8 and 21.  The following text strings are 
                       visible within the viral code in infected files: 
                       "COM" 
                       "+++aTh0m0s7=35dp081,,,,141" 
                       "Armagedon the GREEK" 
                       Origin:  Greece, June 1993 
       Armagedon-1077: Similar to the original Armagedon, this variant 
                       adds 1,077 bytes to infected files.  Its memory 
                       resident TSR is 1,392 bytes in length, and hooks 
                       interrupts 8 and 21.   
                       Isolated:  Greece, September 1991
