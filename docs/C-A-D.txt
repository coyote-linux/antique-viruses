; This virus is of the ?FLOPPY ONLY? variety.                           ;
; It replicates to the boot sector of a floppy disk and when it gains control
; it will move itself to upper memory.  It redirects the keyboard       ;
; interrupt (INT 09H) to look for ALT-CTRL-DEL sequences at which time  ;
; it will attempt to infect any floppy it finds in drive A:.            ;
; It keeps the real boot sector at track 39, sector 8, head 0           ;
; It does not map this sector bad in the fat (unlike the Pakistani Brain)
; and should that area be used by a file, the virus                     ;
; will die.  It also contains no anti detection mechanisms as does the  ;
; BRAIN virus.  It apparently uses head 0, sector 8 and not head 1      ;
; sector 9 because this is common to all floppy formats both single     ;
; sided and double sided.  It does not contain any malevolent TROJAN    ;
; HORSE code.  It does appear to contain a count of how many times it   ;
; has infected other diskettes although this is harmless and the count  ;
; is never accessed.                                                    ;
;                                                                       ;
; Things to note about this virus:                                      ;
; It can not only live through an ALT-CTRL-DEL reboot command, but this ;
; is its primary (only for that matter) means of reproduction to other  ;
; floppy diskettes.  The only way to remove it from an infected system  ;
; is to turn the machine off and reboot an uninfected copy of DOS.      ;
; It is even resident when no floppy is booted but BASIC is loaded      ;
; instead.  Then when ALT-CTRL-DEL is pressed from inside of BASIC,     ;
; it activates and infectes the floppy from which the user is           ;
; attempting to boot.                                                   ;
;                                                                       ;
; Also note that because of the POP CS command to pass control to       ;
; its self in upper memory, this virus does not to work on 80286        ;
; machines (because this is not a valid 80286 instruction).             ;
;                                                                       ;
; If your assembler will not allow the POP CS command to execute, replace;
; the POP CS command with an NOP and then assemble it, then debug that  ;
; part of the code and place POP CS in place of NOP at that section.    ;
;                                                                       ;
; The Norton Utilities can be used to identify infected diskettes by    ;
; looking at the boot sector and the DOS SYS utility can be used to     ;
; remove it (unlike the Pakistani Brain).                               ;
