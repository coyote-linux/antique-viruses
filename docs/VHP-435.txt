 General Comments: 
       The VHP virus is actually a small group or "family" of viruses that 
       was discovered in Bulgaria in early 1990.  There are currently four 
       identified variants to the VHP virus, with the VHP-435 variant 
       being the one with the most potential for spreading.  These viruses 
       were originally based on the Vienna virus.  The progression of the 
       variants shows each variant to be a slightly better replicator. 
 
       The VHP Viruses are: 
       VHP-348: This variant does not replicate due to bugs in the virus 
                code.  If it did replicate, it would infect .COM files. 
                The virus's effective length is 348 bytes. 
       VHP-353: VHP-348 fixed so that it will infected COMMAND.COM, 
                increasing its size by 353 bytes.  It does not infect other 
                .COM files.  This variant is still buggy, and it will 
                occasionally hang systems when attempting to find a .COM 
                file to infect. 
       VHP-367: VHP-353 which will now infect .COM files besides 
                COMMAND.COM.  Infected files increase in size by 367 
                bytes.  Very rarely, this virus will reinfect an infected 
                .COM file.  VHP-353 does not always infect a .COM file 
                when an infected program is executed, it will sometimes 
                not infect any .COM file, though it has in effect 
                immunized the file from infection.  This effect is 
                probably a bug in this variant. 
       VHP-435: Isolated in July, 1989, this variant is 435 bytes in 
                length and is not destructive, all it does is spread. 
                VHP-435 will attempt to infect one file each time an 
                infected program is executed.  COMMAND.COM and .EXE files 
                are not infected.  After infecting all of the .COM files 
                on the current drive and directory, it will attempt to 
                infect drive C:.   VHP-435 is the VHP-367 virus with some 
                modifications to make it less likely to be noticed. 
       VHP-757: Received in November, 1991, VHP-757 is a 757 byte 
                variant of the VHP group of Bulgarian Vienna variants.  It 
                infects one .COM program, but not COMMAND.COM, each time 
                an infected program is executed.  Infected files increase 
                in size by 757 bytes with the virus being located at the 
                end of the infected file.  Replicated samples are typically 
                not very infectious, and rarely will they infect other 
                files. 
       VHP-776: Received in November, 1991, VHP-776 is a 776 byte 
                variant of the VHP group.  It is similar in behaviour to 
                the VHP-757 variant, though it will not infect the first 
                two .COM files in a directory.
