; This virus is an com, exe and partitiontable infector. It will become resident
; after the first reboot. The virus is stored above TOM but below 640k.
; When the virus is resident the virus will infect every com and exe-file that
; is created or opend for read and write. The virus doesn't use any stealth
; techniques. The virus doesn't do anything besides replicate. I don't have
; a good name for it, so I named it 'Digital Research Virus'.
