 General Comments: 
       The Nina virus was received in December, 1990, and is from 
       Bulgaria. This virus is a memory resident infector of .COM files, 
       including COMMAND.COM. 
 
       When the first program infected with the Nina virus is executed, 
       Nina will install itself memory resident at the top of system 
       memory but below the 640K DOS boundary.  Total system memory and 
       available free memory will decrease by 1,024 bytes as shown by the 
       DOS CHKDSK command. Interrupt 21 will be hooked by the virus. 
 
       After Nina is memory resident, it will infect .COM programs that 
       are greater than 256 bytes in length as they are executed.  If 
       COMMAND.COM is executed, it will become infected.  Infected .COM 
       programs increase in length by 256 bytes, and will have the virus 
       located at the beginning of the infected file. 
 
       The Nina virus is named Nina because the virus contains the text 
       string "Nina" within the viral code. 
 
       This virus does not do anything besides replicate. 
 
       Known variant(s) of Nina are: 
       Nina.D: Received in January, 1995, Nina.D is a minor variant 
             of the Nina virus described above.  The text string within 
             the virus has been changed to "RIOT!". 
             Origin:  Unknown  January, 1995.
