 General Comments: 
       The PCBB, or PC Byte Bandit, virus was received in March, 1992.  It 
       originated in Sweden.  This virus is a memory resident infector of 
       COMMAND.COM, though it is very buggy and not really viable in its 
       present state.  It is based on the 1720 virus. 
 
       When a program infected with the PCBB virus is executed, this 
       virus will immediately infect COMMAND.COM.  At this point, the 
       system will be hung.  If the user attempts to boot from the 
       infected COMMAND.COM, the boot will also hang. 
 
       Programs infected with the PCBB virus will have a file length 
       increase of 1,675 - 1,677 bytes.  The virus will be located at 
       the end of the infected file.  The file's date and time in the 
       DOS disk directory listing will have been updated to the system 
       date and time when infection occurred.  The following text string 
       can be found at the end of all infected files: 
 
               "PCBB" 
 
       Known variant(s) of PCBB are: 
       PCBB-3: Received in March, 1992, the PCBB-3, or 1720-C, is a 
               1,719 byte variant of the PCBB virus.  It infects the copy 
               of COMMAND.COM pointed to by the COMSPEC environment variant 
               when the first infected program is executed, as well as 
               becoming memory resident at the top of system memory but 
               below the 640K DOS boundary, hooking interrupts 09, 1C, and 
               21.  Total system memory will have decreased by 4,096 bytes. 
               It does not infect .COM files other than COMMAND.COM. 
               This variant attempts to hide the file length increase on 
               infected files when the virus is memory resident.  The 
               text string "PCBB" can be found at the end of all infected 
               files, and the following text strings are encrypted within 
               its viral code: 
               "<> Demoralized Youth <>" 
               "PCBB, version 3.0" 
               "Written by <: Charlie! :>". 
               Origin:  Sweden  March, 1992. 
       PCBB-3B: Received in October, 1992, the PCBB-3B variant is a 
               1,722 byte variant of the PCBB-3 virus.  It infects the copy 
               of COMMAND.COM pointed to by the COMSPEC environment variant 
               when the first infected program is executed, as well as 
               becoming memory resident at the top of system memory but 
               below the 640K DOS boundary, hooking interrupts 09, 1C, and 
               21.  Total system memory will have decreased by 62,176 bytes. 
               It will occassionally infect programs other than COMMAND.COM, 
               though it is difficult to get it to do this.  This variant 
               attempts to hide the file length increase on infected files 
               when the virus is memory resident.  The text string "PCBB" 
               can be found at the end of all infected files, and the 
               following text strings are encrypted within its viral code: 
               "<> Demoralized Youth <>" 
               "PCBB, version 3.0" 
               "Written by <: Charlie! :>". 
               Origin:  Sweden  October, 1992. 
       PCBB-5: PCBB-5 is a 1,680 byte variant of the PCBB virus.  It 
               becomes memory resident in a manner similar to PCBB-3.  The 
               major difference is that this variant will infect .COM files 
               on open or execution, adding 1,680 bytes to their length. 
               The file length increase is not hidden, and the file date and 
               time in the DOS disk directory listing will be updated to the 
               system date and time when infection occurred.  Like the other 
               members of this group, the text string "PCBB" can be found 
               at the very end of infected files.  It also contains the 
               following text string which is encrypted within the virus: 
               "Pc Byte Bandit ver5". 
               PCBB-5 is a polymorphic virus, employing a complex encryption 
               mechanism. 
               Origin:  Sweden  June, 1992. 
       PCBB-5B: Similar to PCBB-5, this is a minor variant and is 
               functionally equivalent. 
               Origin:  Sweden  June, 1992. 
       PCBB-1141: PCBB-1141 is a 1,141 byte variant of the PCBB virus. 
               It becomes memory resident and infects COMMAND.COM when the 
               first infected program is executed.  Its size in memory is 
               4,096 bytes, located at the top of memory but below the 640K 
               DOS boundary.  Interrupts 09, 1C, and 21 will be hooked. 
               This variant of PCBB only infects COMMAND.COM, not other .COM 
               and .EXE programs.  COMMAND.COM will have increased in size 
               by 1,141 bytes with the virus being located at the end of the 
               infected file, though the file length increase will be hidden 
               when PCBB-1141 is resident.  The file's date and time in the 
               DOS disk directory listing will not be altered.  The text 
               string "PCBB" can be found at the end of all infected 
               programs. 
               Origin:  Sweden  September, 1992. 
       PCBB-3072: Based on the PCBB virus, PCBB-3072 or PCBB-11 is a 
               3,072 byte variant of the virus.  It becomes memory resident 
               and infects COMMAND.COM when the first infected program is 
               executed.  Its size in memory is 6,176 bytes, located at the 
               top of memory but below the 640K DOS boundary.  Interrupts 
               09, 1C, 21, and 24 will be hooked.  Once resident, 
               PCBB-3072 will infect .COM and .EXE programs when they are 
               opened or executed.  Infected files will have a file length 
               increase of 3,072 bytes with the virus being located at the 
               end of the file, though the file length increase will be 
               hidden if PCBB-3072 is memory resident.  When PCBB-3072 is 
               memory resident, the DOS CHKDSK program will indicate file 
               allocation errors on all infected programs.  The file's date 
               and time in the DOS disk directory listing will not be 
               altered.  The following text strings are encrypted within the 
               viral code and are not visible in infected programs: 
               "PCBBCSX.?." 
               ".COM.EXE.BATVBAPW" 
               The text string "PCBB" can be found at the end of all 
               infected programs. 
               Origin:  Sweden  July, 1992.
