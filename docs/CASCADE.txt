 General Comments: 
       Originally, this virus was a Trojan horse which was disguised as a 
       program which was supposed to turn off the Num-Lock light when 
       the system was booted.  The Trojan horse instead caused all the 
       characters on the screen to fall into a pile at the bottom of the 
       screen.  In late 1987, the Trojan horse was changed by someone into 
       a memory resident .COM virus. 
 
       While the original virus had a length of 1,701 bytes and would 
       infect both true IBM PCs and clones, a variation exists of this 
       virus which is 3 bytes longer than the original virus and does not 
       infect true IBM PCs.  Both viruses are functionally identical in all 
       other respects. 
 
       Both of the viruses have some fairly unique qualities:  Both use an 
       encryption algorithm to avoid detection and complicate any attempted 
       analysis of them.  The activation mechanisms are based on a 
       sophisticated randomization algorithm incorporating machine checks, 
       monitor types, presence or absence of a clock card, and the time or 
       season of the year. 
 
       The viruses will activate on any machine with a CGA or VGA monitor 
       in the months of September, October, November, or December in the 
       years 1980 and 1988. 
 
       Known variant(s) of Cascade are: 
       1701 Mutation: Received in October, 1991, this variant of has 
                      had two bytes modified in order to avoid detection. 
       1701-B: Same as 1701, except that it can activate in the Fall of 
               any year. 
       1701-Yap: Based on the original Cascade virus, this variant 
               adds 1,701 bytes to the .COM programs it infects.  Its 
               memory resident TSR is 2,048 bytes, and hooks interrupt 21. 
               The encryption mechanism has been slightly altered to avoid 
               detection by some anti-viral utilities. 
               Origin:  Unknown  October, 1992. 
       1704 Format: Like the Cascade virus, but the disk is formatted 
               when the virus activates.  Activation occurs during the 
               months of October, November, and December of any year except 
               1992. 
               Origin:  Unknown  January, 1989. 
       1704-C: Same as Cascade-B except that the virus can activate in 
               December of any year. 
       1704-D: Same as the 1704, except that the IBM selection has been 
               disabled so that it can infect true IBM PCs. 
       17Y4: Similar to the Cascade 1704 virus, the only difference is 
               one byte in the virus which has been altered. 
       Cascade-1621: Based on the original Cascade virus, this variant 
               adds 1,621 bytes to the .COM programs it infects.  Its 
               memory resident TSR is 1,936 bytes, and hooks interrupt 21. 
               Attempts to execute .BAT files on infected systems may 
               result in the scrolling of the message "Insufficient 
               disk space", and the .BAT file not executing. 
               Origin:  Unknown  June, 1992. 
       Cascade 1701.E: Based on the original Cascade virus, this is a 
               minor variant.  It drops a single character down the system 
               display when it is memory resident from September 1 to 
               December 31 of any year. 
               Origin:  Unknown  September, 1993. 
       Cascade.1702: Based on the original Cascade virus, this variant 
               adds 1,702 bytes to the .COM programs it infects.  It is 
               a memory resident virus which employs a 1,936 byte TSR 
               hooking interrupts 21.  The virus will be located at the end 
               of infected files. 
               Origin:  Unknown  July, 1994. 
       Cascade-1704G: Based on the original Cascade virus, this variant 
               has been altered to avoid detection by some anti-viral 
               programs by the addition of a NOP instruction in the virus' 
               decryption routine.  It adds 1,704 bytes to the .COM programs 
               it infects, with the virus being located at the end of the 
               file.  It is a memory resident virus which employs a 1,968 
               byte TSR hooking interrupt 21. 
               Origin:  France  May, 1993. 
       Cascade-1706: Based on the original Cascade virus, this variant 
               adds 1,706 bytes to the .COM programs it infects.  It is 
               a memory resident virus which employs a 2,064 byte TSR 
               hooking interrupts 1C and 21.  The virus will be located 
               at the end of infected files. 
               Origin:  Unknown  April, 1992. 
       Cascade-B: Similar to the Cascade virus, except that the 
               cascading display has been replaced with a system reboot 
               which will occur at random time intervals after the 
               virus activates. 
       Cunning: Based on the Cascade virus, a major change to the virus is 
               that it now plays music.
