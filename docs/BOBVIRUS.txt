; DEDICATION:
;   This virus was written expressedly to
;      1) Piss off Patty Hoffman, John McAffee, Ross Greenberg, and all the
;         other guru-wanna-bes in this world.
;      2) Spread the message of The Almighty Bob, and so enrichen the lives
;         of people all over the world.
;      3) Show off (Now I can tell people that I wrote a virus!)
;
; WHAT THIS IS:
;   This is a self-encrypting, non-overwriting COM infector.  It doesn't do
;   anything to EXE files.  File sizes increase by 1117 bytes.  It goes off
;   on July 9th of any year or after 7 infection "waves."
;
; WHAT IT DOES WHEN IT GOES OFF:
;   The virus goes memory resident and prints out a Bobism every 5 minutes.
;   It then enters a delay loop for approximately 5 seconds, allowing for a
;   brief moment of silence while the victim reads Bob's holy message.  The
;   virus will not destroy anything.  The virus will not go TSR if it finds
;   another copy of itself in memory.
