 General Comments: 
       The Ranger virus was received in July, 1995.  Its origin or point of 
       isolation is unknown.  Ranger is a non-resident, direct action 
       infector of .COM files, including COMMAND.COM. 
 
       When a program infected with the Ranger virus is executed, this 
       virus will infect one .COM file located in the current directory. 
       Infected programs will have a file length increase of 290 bytes 
       with the virus being located at the end of the file.  The program's 
       date and time in the DOS disk directory listing will not be altered. 
       The following text strings can be found within the viral code in 
       infected programs: 
 
           "*.com" 
           "????????COM" 
           "RANGER" 
 
       The "RANGER" text string can also be found starting in the fourth 
       byte of all infected files.
