 General Comments: 
       The Reboot virus was received in August, 1992.  It is originally 
       from Eastern Europe.  Reboot is a non-resident, direct action 
       infector of .COM programs, including COMMAND.COM. 
 
       When a program infected with the Reboot virus is executed, this 
       virus will infect one .COM program located in the current directory. 
       If COMMAND.COM is located in this directory, it may become infected. 
       Programs infected with the Reboot virus will have a file length 
       increase of 715 bytes with the virus being located at the end 
       of the file.  One text string is visible in infected programs: 
 
               "891221" 
 
       Systems infected with the Reboot virus may experience unexpected 
       system reboots occurring when infected programs are executed.
