 General Comments: 
       The RTL4 virus was submitted in December, 1992, and is from The 
       Netherlands.  RTL4 is a non-resident, direct action infector of 
       .COM programs, including COMMAND.COM. 
 
       When a program infected with the RTL4 virus is executed, the RTL4 
       virus will infect one .COM program located in the current directory, 
       along with displaying the following message: 
 
               "RTL4" 
               "Joop van den Ende Produkties BV 
                Marco Daas (Casting Assistent) 
                Postbus 397

                The Netherlands 
                Wedden dat... je een virus hebt?" 
 
       A system hang will then occur.  The above text is encrypted within 
       infected files, so it is not visible. 
 
       Programs infected with the RTL4 virus will have a file length 
       increase of 503 bytes with the virus being located at the end of 
       the file.  The program's date and time in the DOS disk directory 
       listing will not be altered.  In addition to the above text, the 
       following text string is also encrypted within infected files: 
 
               "*.COM" 
 
       The individual and the addresses indicated above are displayed 
       by the virus, but should not be construed to indicate that this 
       individual wrote the virus.

;
; Now in front of you lies another source of a virus. It is not a very good
; one, but, as you might say, a virus is a virus. After my wake at the PC, I
; created several viruses, like:
;
; Deicide / Glenn
; Morgoth
; Breeze
; Brother
; Commentator I
; Commentator II
; Spawnie
; Xmas
; 1St_Star / 222
; T-1000
;
; Well, I bet you think this is a whole lot, but some are minor variants, for
; which I don't have the guts to publish the source code. I have to admid,
; Deicide and Morgoth have spread very well. I uploaded them to a BBS and it
; was downloaded several times, and it is not detected by antivirus program yet.
; Deicide is now detectable, but that was my first attempt to make a virus.
;
; This virus is a Non-Resident Direct Action .COM Infector.
; It only infects files in the current directory.
; You can recognize a infected file simply, the 4th byte is a '*' (just like
; the 1St_Star virus). It is inactive from January till May and starts
; replicating from May. After July, every Wednessday after the 21st the
; program will hang the system, showing the address of RTL4 Joop v/d Ende
; Productions.
;
; Disclaimer : This program is like all other virus sources only for
; educational purposes and should not be given to irresponsible hands
; (John McAfee and people like him).
;
; For the criminal reader : Don't just change the text of this virus and
; say you made a virus. Instead use some ideas from this virus and create your
; own virus if you want to be nasty. Additions to this virus that makes it
; spreading faster and makes it harder to detect are welcome, as long as I get
; the new source code.
;
; I want to thank several virus writers for their support with letting McAfee
; and Ass. earn his money with making so many updates of SCAN...
; Here they are : Bit Addict, XSTC, Dark Helmet, Dark Avenger, Nuke!, Cracker
; Jack and many more creators.
;
; Note to XSTC : Thank you for disassembling the Deicide virus, for I have lost
; the source code. Next time write a message, because I might have the source
; code of the virus ready, but not uploaded. It saves you time, so you may
; disassemble another virus (ofcourse only for educational purposes ;-) )
;
; Now have fun with this virus, written in A86 assembler version 3.22
