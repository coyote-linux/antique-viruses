; This is a spawning virus I decided to take to the limit,
; to step on the accelerator of the VCL, so to speak.
; HEEVAHAVA virus is a 'companion' .EXE infector which will attempt
; to infect almost 20 files anywhere on the disk every run. It will mess
; with low RAM, beep the speaker, disable COM port 1, entangle LPT1 and LPT2,
; nullify print screen and finally, when the disk is completely saturated
; with HEEVAHAVA virus it will display the msg, "Only heeva-hava's get stuck
; with the HEEVAHAVA virus!" Note: a 'heevahava' is a Pennsylvania
; Dutch pejorative. Colloquially, it was the name given to the farmhand
; given the job of holding the bull's pecker while semen was collected.
