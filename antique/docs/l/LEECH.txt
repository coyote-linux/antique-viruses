 General Comments: 
       The Leech virus was submitted in May, 1991.  Leech is from 
       Bulgaria.  It is a memory resident infector of .COM programs, 
       including COMMAND.COM. 
 
       The first time a program infected with Leech is executed, the virus 
       will install itself memory resident at the top of system memory but 
       below the 640K DOS boundary.  Total system and available memory, 
       as measured by the DOS CHKDSK program, will decrease by 2,080 bytes. 
       Interrupt 21 will be hooked by the virus.  Leech also makes use of 
       interrupt 2F. 
 
       Once Leech is memory resident, it will infect .COM programs over 
       approximately 10K in size when they are executed.  Infected programs 
       will increase in size by 1,024 bytes, but the size increase will not 
       be visible in the disk directory if Leech is memory resident. 
       Programs which originally had a file time of 12:00a before infection 
       will have their time disappear from the disk directory when viewed 
       with Leech resident.  Leech is located at the beginning of infected 
       programs.  Infected files will contain the following text string: 
 
               "The leech live ... April 1991 The Topler" 
 
       Leech is a stealth virus.  If it is memory resident, anti-viral 
       programs which are unaware of Leech will be unable to detect its 
       presence on the system. 
 
       It is unknown if Leech does anything besides replicate. 
 
       Known variant(s) of Leech are: 
       Leech.1008: Received in January, 1996, Leech.1008 is a 1,008 
               byte variant of the Leech virus described above.  Its size 
               in memory is approximately 2,048 bytes, hooking interrupt 
               21.  Once resident, it infects .COM files when they are 
               executed, opened, or copied. Infected files will have a file 
               length increase of 1,008 bytes, with the virus being located 
               in the beginning of the file.  The program's date and time 
               in the DOS disk directory listing will appear to be 
               unaltered, though the seconds field will have been set 
               to "60".  The following text strings are visible within the 
               viral code: 
               "Super, Super!" 
               "March 1993,   Tazta" 
               Origin:  Unknown  January, 1996. 
       Leech.1025: Received in July, 1995, Leech.1025 is a 1,025 
               byte variant of the Leech virus described above.  Its size 
               in memory is approximately 4.1 kilobytes, hooking interrupt 
               21.  Once resident, it infects .COM files when they are 
               executed.  Leech.1025 infected files will have a file length 
               increase of 1,025 bytes, though the file length increase 
               will be hidden when the virus is memory resident.  The virus 
               will be located at the beginning of the file.  The file's 
               date and time in the DOS disk directory listing will appear 
               to be unaltered, though the seconds field will have been set 
               to "60".  The following text string is visible within the 
               viral code: 
               "Insane Reality..   The Unforgiven / IR.." 
               The DOS CHKDSK program will return file allocation errors 
               on all infected files when the virus is memory resident. 
               Origin:  Sweden  July, 1995. 
       Leech.1026: Received in February, 1995, Leech.1026 is a 1,026 
               byte variant of the Leech virus described above.  Its size 
               in memory is approximately 4.1 kilobytes, hooking interrupt 
               21.  Once resident, it infects .COM files when they are 
               executed.  Leech.1026 infected files will have a file length 
               increase of 1,026 bytes, though the file length increase 
               will be hidden when the virus is memory resident.  The virus 
               will be located at the beginning of the file.  The file's 
               date and time in the DOS disk directory listing will appear 
               to be unaltered, though the seconds field will have been set 
               to "60".  The following text string is visible within the 
               viral code: 
               "Insane Reality..   The Unforgiven / IR.." 
               The DOS CHKDSK program will return file allocation errors 
               on all infected files when the virus is memory resident. 
               Origin:  Sweden  February, 1995. 
       Leech2: Functionally equivalent to the original virus, Leech2 
               has seven bytes which differ.  Leech2 will also infect 
               programs when they are opened for any reason.
