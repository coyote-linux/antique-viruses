 General Comments: 
       The Yankee 2, or Yankee virus, was isolated in Bulgaria in 1989. 
       Unlike the Yankee Doodle virus, the Yankee 2 virus is not memory 
       resident.  It also only infects .EXE files, adding 1,961 bytes to 
       their length.  The virus will attempt to infect an .EXE file in the 
       current directory whenever an infected program is executed.  If it 
       is successful in locating an uninfected .EXE file, and infects it, 
       Yankee Doodle will be played on the system speaker.  Infected files 
       will have the hex string '6D6F746865726675636B6572' at the end. 
 
       The Yankee 2 virus will not infect CodeView.
