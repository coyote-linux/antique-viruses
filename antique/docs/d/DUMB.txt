 General Comments: 
       The Dumb virus was received in January, 1996.  Its origin or point 
       of isolation is unknown.  Dumb is a memory resident infector of 
       .COM files, including COMMAND.COM. 
 
       When the first Dumb infected program is executed, this virus will 
       install itself memory resident in low available free memory, hooking 
       interrupt 21.  Total system and available free memory will not be 
       altered. 
 
       Once the Dumb virus is memory resident, it will infect .COM files 
       when they are opened or executed, but not on copy.  Infected .COM 
       files will have a file length increase of 406 bytes with the virus 
       being located at the end of the file.  The program's date and time 
       in the DOS disk directory listing will not appear to be altered, 
       though the seconds field will have been set to "60".  The following 
       text strings are visible within the viral code: 
 
           "Dumï¿½" 
           "[filename] fuck" 
           "trashes HD" 
 
       It is unknown what the Dumb virus may do besides replicate.
