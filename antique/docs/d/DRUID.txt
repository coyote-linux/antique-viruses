 General Comments: 
       The Druid virus was submitted in October, 1992.  It is a non-resident 
       direct action infector of .COM programs, but not COMMAND.COM.  It 
       overwrites the beginning of the programs it infects, permanently 
       corrupting them. 
 
       When a program infected with the Druid virus is executed, the Druid 
       virus will infect all of the .COM programs located in the current 
       directory.  Once it has completed infecting the .COM files in the 
       current directory, it will move up one directory at a time in the 
       directory structure, infecting programs, until it finally infects 
       the current drive root directory.  It avoids infecting COMMAND.COM. 
     
       Programs infected with the Druid virus will normally not increase 
       in size.  The exception is that if the original program was smaller 
       than 317 bytes in length, the program will become 317 bytes in 
       length.  The file's date and time in the DOS disk directory listing 
       will not be altered.  The following text string can be found within 
       the viral code in all infected programs: 
 
               "DRUID, coded by Morbid Angel/Line Noise" 
 
       Systems infected with Druid will notice long disk accesses occurring 
       when .COM programs are executed.  The long disk access is due to the 
       virus infecting .COM programs in several directories.  Infected 
       programs will not function properly.
