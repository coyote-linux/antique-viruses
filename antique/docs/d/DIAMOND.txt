 General Comments: 
       The Diamond entry in HyperText VSUM actually represents several 
       members of the group or family of viruses which are based on the 
        V1024  virus from Bulgaria. 
 
       The viruses indicated below are based on the V1024 virus, and 
       were received as part of a large library of viruses.  As such, 
       their origin and time of discovery are completely unknown.  The 
       viruses in this group are all memory resident infectors of .COM 
       and/or .EXE programs, and in most cases programs will not function 
       properly with the virus memory resident. 
 
       Known member(s) of the Diamond family are: 
       Diamond-444: A 444 byte virus based on the V1024 virus.  It 
                    infects .COM and .EXE programs when they are executed. 
                    Infected programs increase in size by 444 bytes with 
                    the virus being located at the end of the file.  The 
                    program's date and time in the DOS disk directory 
                    listing is not altered.  Diamond-444 cannot determine 
                    when it has previously infected a file, so programs will 
                    be reinfected, adding an additional 444 bytes with each 
                    reinfection.  The following text string is visible in 
                    the viral code in all infected programs: 
                    "9090909090" 
                    With Diamond-444 memory resident, execution of any 
                    program will result in the message "EXEC failure" 
                    being displayed, and the user returned to the DOS 
                    prompt. 
                    Origin:  Unknown  June, 1993. 
       Diamond-465: A 465 byte virus based on the V1024 virus.  It 
                    infects .COM and .EXE programs when they are executed. 
                    Infected programs increase in size by 465 bytes with 
                    the virus being located at the end of the file.  The 
                    program's date and time in the DOS disk directory 
                    listing is not altered.  Diamond-465 cannot determine 
                    when it has previously infected a file, so programs will 
                    be reinfected, adding an additional 465 bytes with each 
                    reinfection.  The following text string is visible in 
                    the viral code in all infected programs: 
                    "9090909090" 
                    With Diamond-465 memory resident, execution of any 
                    program will result in the message "EXEC failure" 
                    being displayed, and the user returned to the DOS 
                    prompt. 
                    Origin:  Unknown  June, 1993. 
       Diamond-485: A 485 byte virus based on the V1024 virus.  It 
                    infects .COM and .EXE programs when they are executed. 
                    Infected programs increase in size by 485 bytes with 
                    the virus being located at the end of the file.  The 
                    program's date and time in the DOS disk directory 
                    listing is not altered.  Diamond-485 cannot determine 
                    when it has previously infected a file, so programs will 
                    be reinfected, adding an additional 485 bytes with each 
                    reinfection.  The following text string is visible in 
                    the viral code in all infected programs: 
                    "7106286813" 
                    With Diamond-485 memory resident, execution of any 
                    program will result in the message "EXEC failure" 
                    being displayed, and the user returned to the DOS 
                    prompt.

                    program will result in the message "EXEC failure" 
                    being displayed, and the user returned to the DOS
