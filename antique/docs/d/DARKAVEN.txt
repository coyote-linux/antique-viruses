 General Comments: 
       Dark Avenger was first isolated in the United States at the 
       University of California at Davis.  It infects .COM, .EXE, and 
       overlay files, including COMMAND.COM.  The virus will install itself 
       into system memory, becoming resident, and is extremely prolific at 
       infecting any executable files that are opened for any reason. 
       This includes using the DOS COPY and XCOPY commands to copy 
       uninfected files, both the source and the target files will end up 
       being infected.  Infected files will have their lengths increased by 
       1,800 bytes. 
 
       The Dark Avenger virus does perform malicious damage.  The virus 
       maintains a counter in the disk's boot sector.  After each sixteenth 
       file is infected, the virus will randomly overwrite a sector on the 
       disk with a portion of the Dark Avenger virus code.  If the randomly 
       selected sector is a portion of a program or data file, the program 
       or data file will be corrupted.  Programs and data files which have 
       been corrupted by a sector being overwritten are permanently damaged 
       and cannot be repaired since the original sector is lost. 
 
       If you are infected with Dark Avenger, shutdown your computer and 
       reboot from a Write Protected boot diskette for the system, then 
       carefully use a disinfector, following all instructions. Be sure to 
       re-scan the system for infection once you have finished disinfecting 
       it. 
 
       The Dark Avenger virus contains the words: "The Dark Avenger, 
       copyright 1988, 1989", as well as the message: "This program was 
       written in the city of Sofia.  Eddie lives.... Somewhere in Time!". 
 
       This virus bears no resemblance or similarity to the Jerusalem 
       viruses, even though they are similar in size. 
 
       Known variant(s) of Dark Avenger are: 
       Amilia: Based on the Dark Avenger virus, Amilia adds 1,614 bytes 
               to the .COM and .EXE programs it infects.  It will also 
               infect COMMAND.COM.  The virus will be located at the end of 
               infected files.  Decrease in total system and available free 
               memory, as indicated by the DOS CHKDSK program, will be 1,632 
               bytes.  Interrupt 21 will be hooked.  The Amilia virus 
               activates on February 2nd, at which time it will display the 
               following message after becoming memory resident, and a 
               system hang will occur: 
               "AmiLiA I Virii - [NukE] 
                Released Dec91 Montreal 
                (C) NukE Development Software Inc." 
               Besides the above message, the following text strings can be 
               found within the viral code in infected programs: 
               "antideb" 
               "AmiLiA I Virii  -  [NukE] i99i  By Rock Steady/NukE" 
               Origin:  Montreal, Canada  December, 1991. 
       Boroda: Similar to Dark Avenger-D, this variant contains only 
               one text string: "B O R O D A".  It adds 1,800 bytes to the 
               .COM files it infects, and 1,800 to 1,814 bytes to the 
               .EXE files it infects.  Decrease in total system and 
               available free memory, as indicated by the DOS CHKDSK 
               program, will be 3,696 bytes.  Interrupts 21 and 27 will be 
               hooked.  As with the original Dark Avenger, it will 
               modify the disk boot sector, and occassionally overwrite a 
               sector of the disk with a copy of itself, thus damaging 
               files. 
               Origin:  Unknown  January, 1992. 
       Dark Avenger.1E: Similar to Dark Avenger-D, this variant adds 
                       1,800 bytes to the .COM programs it infects, and 
                       1,800 to 1,814 bytes to the infected .EXE programs. 
                       In both cases, the virus is located at the end of 
                       the infected program.  The text strings in this 
                       variant are: 
                       "Eddie lives...somewhere in time!" 
                       "Diana P." 
                       "This program was written in the city of Sofia" 
                       "(C) 1988-89 Dark Avenger" 
                       Systems infected with Dark Avenger.1E will notice 
                       that boot sectors will be slightly altered, and 
                       programs and files may become slowly corrupted. 
                       Once the system is booted from an infected 
                       COMMAND.COM, the system date's format may be changed 
                       from "mm/dd/yy" to "yyyy#mm#dd", and the ":" 
                       character in the system time changed to "". 
                       Origin:  Bulgaria  June, 1992. 
       Dark Avenger.Major: Based on the Dark Avenger virus, this variant 
                       adds 1,832 bytes to the .COM programs it infects, and 
                       1,832 to 1,846 bytes to .EXE programs.  In both cases, 
                       the virus is located at the end of the infected file. 
                       The text strings in this variant are: 
                       "Written In turbo Assember v2.84" 
                       "(C) 1992 MajorBBS Patch v1.0" 
                       "This Program Was Written To Patch The Backdoor Of 
                        MajorBBS" 
                       "(C) 1992 by Leroy Janowa" 
                       Systems infected with Dark Avenger.Major will notice 
                       that boot sectors will be slightly altered, and 
                       programs and files may become slowly corrupted. 
                       Origin:  Unknown  July, 1994. 
       Dark Avenger.Shyster: Based on the Dark Avenger virus, this 
                       variant's size in memory is 3,712 bytes, hooking 
                       interrupts 21 and 27.  It adds 1,802 bytes to the .COM 
                       programs it infects, and 1,802 to 1,816 bytes to .EXE 
                       programs.  In both cases, the virus is located at the 
                       end of the infected file.  One text string can be 
                       found within the viral code in infected files: 
                       "Shyster" 
                       Systems infected with Dark Avenger.Shyter will notice 
                       that boot sectors will be slightly altered, and 
                       programs and files may become slowly corrupted. 
                       Origin:  Unknown  August, 1994. 
       Dark Avenger-B: Very similar to the Dark Avenger virus, the major 
                       difference is that .COM files will be reinfected, 
                       adding 1,800 bytes to the file length with each 
                       infection.  This variant also becomes memory 
                       resident in high system memory instead of being a 
                       low system memory TSR. Text strings found in the 
                       virus's code include: 
                           "Eddie lives...somewhere in time!" 
                           "Diana P." 
                           "This program was written in the city of Sofia" 
                           "(C)1988-1989 Dark Avenger" 
       Dark Avenger-C: Very similar to the Dark Avenger virus, this 
                       variant adds 1,800 to 1,814 bytes to infected files. 
                       The copyright notice is also different, having been 
                       changed to: "(C) 1988-89 Dark Avenger". 
       Dark Avenger-D: This variant is very similar to Dark Avenger-C, 
                       adding 1,800 to 1,814 bytes to infected files.  It 
                       has the same copyright notice as Dark Avenger-C. 
       Dark Avenger-Romanian: Received in November, 1992, this variant 
                       of Dark Avenger is from Romania.  The major change 
                       with this variant is that it will only infect .EXE 
                       programs, adding 1,800 to 1,814 bytes to the file's 
                       length.  It contains the same text strings as 
                       Dark Avenger-B. 
                       Origin:  Romania  November, 1992. 
       Dark Avenger 1801: Similar to the Dark Avenger virus, the major 
                          difference is that this variant has an effective 
                          length of 1,801 bytes, one byte longer than the 
                          Dark Avenger virus.  Like Dark Avenger-B, it will 
                          become memory resident at the top of system memory 
                          instead of being a low system memory TSR.  It does 
                          not, however, reinfect .COM files as Dark Avenger-B 
                          does.  The same text strings found in Dark Avenger 
                          and Dark Avenger-B appear in this variant. 
       Dark Avenger-1693: The Dark Avenger-1693 variant is a 1,693 byte 
              variant of the Dark Avenger virus.  Its size in memory is 3,696 
              bytes at the top of system memory but below the 640K DOS 
              boundary, hooking interrupts 21 and 27.  It adds 1,693 bytes to 
              the .COM programs it infects, and 1,693 to 1,707 bytes to .EXE 
              programs.  The virus will be located at the end of the file, 
              and the file's date and time in the DOS disk directory listing 
              will not be altered.  This variant does not hide the file 
              length increase.  The boot sector of infected disks will have 
              been altered as the virus keeps a counter there. No text 
              strings are visible within the viral code.  Programs infected 
              with this variant will frequently hang the system when they are 
              executed. 
              Origin:  Unknown  January, 1994. 
       Dark Avenger.1797: The Dark Avenger.1797 variant is a 1,797 byte 
              variant of the Dark Avenger virus.  Its size in memory is 3,696 
              bytes at the top of system memory but below the 640K DOS 
              boundary, hooking interrupts 21 and 27.  It adds 1,797 bytes to 
              the .COM programs it infects, and 1,797 to 1,811 bytes to .EXE 
              programs.  The virus will be located at the end of the file, 
              and the file's date and time in the DOS disk directory listing 
              will not be altered.  This variant does not hide the file 
              length increase.  The boot sector of infected disks will have 
              been altered as the virus keeps a counter there. The following 
              text strings are visible within the viral code in infected 
              programs: 
              "McAfee and Associated (C)1992" 
              "Diana P." 
              "This program was written in the city of Sofia 
               (C) 1988-89 Dark Avenger" 
              Origin:  Unknown  August, 1994. 
       Dark Avenger-1799: The Dark Avenger-1799 variant is a 1,799 byte 
              variant of the Dark Avenger virus.  Its size in memory is 3,696 
              bytes at the top of system memory but below the 640K DOS 
              boundary, hooking interrupts 21 and 27.  It adds 1,799 bytes to 
              the .COM programs it infects, and 1,799 to 1,813 bytes to .EXE 
              programs.  The virus will be located at the end of the file, 
              and the file's date and time in the DOS disk directory listing 
              will not be altered.  This variant does not hide the file 
              length increase.  The boot sector of infected disks will have 
              been altered as the virus keeps a counter there. The following 
              text strings are visible within the viral code in infected 
              programs: 
              "Francis lives...in Hong Kong!" 
              "Diana P." 
              "This program was written in the city of Sofia 
               (C) 1988-89 Dark Avenger" 
              Origin:  Unknown  January, 1994. 
       Dark Avenger.1800.Satan: The Dark Avenger.1800.Satan variant is a 
              1,800 byte variant of the Dark Avenger virus.  Its size in 
              memory is 3,696 bytes at the top of system memory but below the 
              640K DOS boundary, hooking interrupts 21 and 27.  It adds 1,800 
              bytes to the .COM programs it infects, and 1,800 to 1,814 bytes 
              to .EXE programs.  The virus will be located at the end of the 
              file, and the file's date and time in the DOS disk directory 
              listing will not be altered.  This variant does not hide the 
              file length increase.  The boot sector of infected disks will 
              have been altered as the virus keeps a counter there. The 
              following text strings are visible within the viral code in 
              infected programs: 
              "Satan Virus * Satan Ver 2.09" 
              "- Satan Virus - 1994 Written by Mad Satan in 
               TAIWAN.  =Ver 2.09=" 
              Origin:  Unknown  August, 1994. 
       Dark Avenger-1813: The Dark Avenger-1813 variant is a 1,813 byte 
              variant of the Dark Avenger virus.  Its size in memory is 3,696 
              bytes at the top of system memory but below the 640K DOS 
              boundary, hooking interrupts 21 and 27.  It adds 1,813 bytes to 
              the .COM programs it infects, and 1,813 to 1,827 bytes to .EXE 
              programs.  The virus will be located at the end of the file, 
              and the file's date and time in the DOS disk directory listing 
              will not be altered.  The Dark Avenger-1813 virus attempts to 
              hide the file length increase on infected files, though on .EXE 
              programs they may appear to have increased in size by up to 16 
              bytes when the virus is memory resident.  This variant is also 
              unable to determine properly when it has previously infected 
              a file, so it ends up reinfecting files.  Reinfections will add 
              an additional 1,813 bytes to the file, this increase is not 
              hidden by the virus in memory.  The boot sector of infected 
              disks will have been altered as the virus keeps a counter 
              there. The following text strings are visible within the viral 
              code in infected programs: 
              "Eddie lives...somewhere in time!" 
              "Diana P." 
              "This program was written in the city of Sofia 
               (C) 1988-89 Dark Avenger" 
              Origin:  Unknown  January, 1994. 
       Dark Quest: The Dark Quest variant is a 1,800 byte variant of 
              the Dark Avenger virus.  Dark Quest's size in memory is 3,696 
              bytes at the top of system memory but below the 640K DOS 
              boundary, hooking interrupts 21, 22, and 27.  It adds 1,800 
              bytes to the .COM programs it infects, and 1,800 to 1,815 
              bytes to .EXE programs.  The virus will be located at the end 
              of the file, and the file's date and time in the DOS disk 
              directory listing will not be altered.  This variant does not 
              hide the file length increase.  The boot sector of infected 
              disks will have been altered as the virus keeps a counter 
              there. The following text strings can be found within the 
              viral code in all Dark Quest infected programs: 
              "Never buy Quest computers again!" 
              "iana P." 
              "This program is not dangerous stamp." 
              "All new software seriosly danger" 
              Origin:  Unknown  December, 1992. 
       Evil Men: Similar to Dark Avenger-D, this variant contains the 
                 following text strings: 
                 "The evil that men do !" 
                 "This program was written in the city of Sofia" 
                 "(C) 1988-89 Dark Avenger" 
                 "Diana P." 
                 Origin:  Unknown  January, 1992. 
       Kang Yong: The Kang Yong variant is a 1,947 byte variant of Dark 
              Avenger.  Unlike other members of this group, it reinfects 
              previously infected programs.  Kang Yong's size in memory is 
              3,984 bytes at the top of system memory but below the 640K 
              DOS boundary, hooking interrupts 21 and 27.  It adds 1,947 
              bytes to the .COM programs it infects, and 1,947 to 1,961 
              bytes to .EXE programs.  Reinfections will add an additional 
              1,947 bytes.  The virus will be located at the end of the 
              file, and the file's date and time in the DOS disk directory 
              listing will not be altered.  This variant does not hide the 
              file length increase.  The boot sector of infected diskettes 
              will have been altered as the virus keeps a counter there. 
              The following text strings can be found within the viral 
              code: 
              "If you are a thieve man , virus lives...somewhere always!" 
              "You must become good man!" 
              "Kang Yong II" 
              "This program was adjustted in 'Commputer Home' of KOREA"

              Origin:  Korea  October, 1992. 
       Mercury: The Mercury variant is a 2,829 byte variant of the Dark 
              Avenger virus.  Its size in memory is 5,808 bytes at the top of 
              system memory but below the 640K DOS boundary, hooking 
              interrupts 08, 21 and 27.  It adds 2,829 bytes to the .COM 
              programs it infects, and 2,829 to 2,843 bytes to .EXE programs. 
              Mercury hides this file length increase when it is memory 
              resident.  The virus will be located at the end of the file, 
              and the file's date and time in the DOS disk directory listing 
              will not be altered.  The boot sector of infected disks will 
              not be altered. The following text strings are encrypted within 
              the viral code in infected programs: 
              "If You Liked This Virus, Call Asaf, At +972-4-225288!" 
              "Written by Jasper, and Dedicated to Freddie Mercury." 
              Symptoms of a Mercury infection include a sluggish response to 
              DOS DIR commands, DOS CHKDSK file allocation errors on all 
              infected programs, as well as random sectors being overwritten 
              on the current drive. 
              Origin:  Unknown  January, 1994. 
       PS!KO: The PS!KO variant of Dark Avenger was received in 
              November, 1991.  It is from the United States.  It addes 
              1,803 to 1,817 bytes to programs which it infects.  The 
              following text strings can be found in infected programs: 
              "The Ps!ko Virus - Version 1.0" 
              "The Ps!ko Virus - Written in the USA," 
              "(C)1991 by SiTT and The Viola" 
              Symptoms of an infection by PS!KO include .COM programs 
              failing to execute properly, and frequent system hangs. 
              Origin:  United States  November, 1991. 
       PS!KO-1459: The PS!KO-1459 variant is based on the PS!KO-1687 
              variant described below.  PS!KO-1459's size in memory is 
              3,040 bytes at the top of system memory but below the 640K 
              DOS boundary, hooking interrupts 21 and 27.  It adds 1,459 
              bytes to the .COM programs it infects, and 1,459 to 1,473 
              bytes to .EXE programs.  In both cases, the virus will be 
              located at the end of the file, and the file's date and time 
              in the DOS disk directory listing will not be altered.  This 
              variant hides the file length increase when the virus is 
              memory resident.  The DOS CHKDSK program will return file 
              allocation errors on all infected programs when PS!KO-1459 is 
              in memory.  There are no text strings within the viral code. 
              Origin:  United States  September, 1992. 
       PS!KO-1687: The PS!KO-1687 variant is based on the PS!KO-1800 
              variant described below.  PS!KO-1687's size in memory is 
              3,472 bytes, hooking interrupts 21 and 27.  It adds 1,687 
              bytes to the .COM programs it infects, and 1,687 to 1,701 
              bytes to .EXE programs.  In both cases, the virus will be 
              located at the end of the file, and the file's date and time 
              in the DOS disk directory listing will not be altered.  This 
              variant does not hide the file length increase when it is 
              memory resident.   There are no text strings within the viral 
              code. 
              Origin:  United States  September, 1992. 
       PS!KO-1800: The PS!KO-1800 variant is based on the PS!KO variant 
              described above.  PS!KO-1800's size in memory is 3,696 bytes, 
              hooking interrupts 21 and 27.  It adds 1,800 bytes to the .COM 
              programs it infects, and 1,800 to 1,814 bytes to the .EXE 
              programs it infects.  In both cases, the virus will be located 
              at the end of the file, and the file's date and time in the 
              DOS disk directory listing will not be altered.  This variant 
              does not hide the file length increase when it is memory 
              resident.  The following text strings can be found in 
              infected programs: 
              "The Ps!ko Virus -- Version 1.0" 
              "SiTT" 
              "The Ps!ko Virus - Written in the USA, 
               (C)1991 by SiTT and The Violator" 
              Origin:  United States  September, 1992. 
       Rabid Avenger: Rabid Avenger was isolated in the United States in 
                      April 1991.  This variant of Dark Avenger is based on 
                      the Dark Avenger-B variant.  Its memory resident 
                      portion is located at the top of system memory but 
                      below the 640K DOS boundary, and is 3,696 bytes in 
                      length.  Interrupts 21 and 27 are hooked. Infected 
                      .COM files will increase in length by 1,800 bytes. 
                      Infected .EXE files will increase in size by 1,806 to 
                      1,823 bytes.  In both cases, the virus will be 
                      located at the end of the infected file.  Text 
                      strings found in the virus's code include: 
                         "<- Thanks to the Dark Avenger ->" 
                         "Eat us!" 
                         "(C) 1991 RABID International Development Corp!" 
                         "Scan String Killer Test" 
                      This variant has also been altered so as to avoid 
                      detection by anti-viral utilities which are able to 
                      detect Dark Avenger. 
       Sneaker: Sneaker was submitted in September, 1991.  Its origin 
                or point of isolation is unknown.  The following text 
                strings are visible within the viral code: 
                "Nadia FOTTIT!!...By the Sneaker" 
                "Diana P." 
                "This was written in the city of Sofia 
                 (C) 1988-89 Dark Avenger" 
                 Infected .COM programs will increase in size by 1,800 
                 bytes with the virus being located at the end of the 
                 infected file.  Infected .EXE programs increase in size 
                 by 1,800 to 1,814 bytes with the virus also at the end 
                 of the infected file. 
                 Origin:  Unknown  September, 1993. 
       VAN Soft: VAN Soft was received from Europe in May, 1991.  This 
                 variant is from Bulgaria and is based on the original 
                 Dark Avenger virus.  The major change in this variant is 
                 that the text strings have been altered so that they are 
                 now: 
 
                      "V.A.N. Soft & MMMM PRESENT:SOFIA" 
                      "VAN&MMMM" 
 
                 Infected .COM programs will increase in size by 1,800 
                 bytes with the virus being located at the end of the 
                 infected file.  Infected .EXE programs increase in size 
                 by 1,806 to 1,824 bytes with the virus also at the end 
                 of the infected file.
