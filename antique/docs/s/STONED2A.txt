 General Comments: 
       The Stoned virus was first reported in Wellington, New Zealand in 
       early 1988.  The original virus only infected 360KB 5-1/4" 
       diskettes, doing no overt damage.  The original diskette-only 
       infector is extinct, however, and all known variants of this virus 
       are capable of infecting the hard disk master boot sector 
       (partition table) as well as may damage directory or FAT 
       information.  Most variants of this virus have only minor 
       modifications, usually in what the message is that the virus may 
       display on boot. 
 
       When a computer system is booted with a Stoned infected disk, this 
       virus will install itself memory resident at the top of system 
       memory. The interrupt 12 return will be moved, and ChkDsk will 
       indicate that the computer system as 2K less total memory than what 
       is installed.  If the system boot was from a diskette, the virus 
       will also attempt to infect the hard disk master boot sector, if it 
       was not previously infected. 
 
       During the boot process, the Stoned virus may display a message. 
       The message is displayed more or less on a random basis.  The most 
       common text for the message is: 
 
               "Your computer is now stoned." 
 
       Or: 
 
               "Your PC is now Stoned!" 
 
       After Stoned is memory resident, it will infect diskettes as they 
       are accessed on the system.  When Stoned infects a diskette, it 
       moves the original boot sector (sector 0) to sector 11.  The Stoned 
       virus then copies itself into sector 0.  Since sector 11 is 
       normally part of the diskette root directory on 360K 5.25" 
       diskettes, any files which had their directory entries located in 
       this sector will be lost.  Some versions of DOS have sector 11 as 
       part of the File Allocation Table, which may also result in the 
       disk's FAT being corrupted. 
 
       When Stoned infects that system hard disk, it copies the hard disk's 
       original master boot sector to side 0, cyl 0, sector 7.  A copy 
       of the Stoned virus is then placed at side 0, cyl 0, sector 1, the 
       original location of the hard disk master boot sector.  If the hard 
       disk was formatted with software which starts the boot sector, file 
       allocation table, or disk directory on side 0, cyl 0 right after 
       the master boot sector, the hard disk may be corrupted as well. 
 
       In order to disinfect a system infected with the Stoned virus, the 
       system must be powered off and booted with an uninfected, write- 
       protected boot diskette.  If this is not done, the virus may 
       re-infect diskettes as soon as they are disinfected. 
 
       There are many programs which can disinfect Stoned infected 
       diskettes and hard disks.  To successfully use one of these, follow 
       the instructions with the program. 
 
       To remove Stoned manually, the DOS SYS command can be used on 5.25" 
       360K diskettes.  On the hard disk, the original master boot sector 
       must be copied back to side 0, cyl 0, sector 1.  This can be 
       performed with Norton Utilities, or other sector editors. 
 
       Known variant(s) of Stoned are: 
       Deunis : Based on the Stoned virus, Deunis is a variant received 
               from Spain in July, 1991.  The text contained within the 
               virus is now: 
               "�Deun�s abras� tu Cpu!" 
               "(c) IMAN4" 
       PS-Stoned: Based on the Stoned virus, PS-Stoned is a variant which 
                  has been altered to avoid detection.  Unlike most 
                  members of the Stoned Family, PS-Stoned does not contain 
                  a message, and does not display any message when the 
                  system is booted from an infected disk.  This variant 
                  will infect the boot sector of both normal and 
                  high-density diskettes, as well as the hard disk master 
                  boot sector.  In the case of the master boot sector, the 
                  original master boot sector is moved to cylinder 0, 
                  side 0, sector 17.  On low density diskettes, the 
                  original boot sector is moved to sector 11, while on 
                  high density diskettes it can be found at sector 16. 
                  This variant was originally received in February, 1991, 
                  from New Brunswick, Canada after being isolated at a 
                  university.  As of May, 1991, no anti-viral products 
                  detect this variant which can be just about invisible on 
                  infected systems. 
       Rostov: Similar to Stoned-B, this variant does not display any 
               message.  It contains the text: "Non-system disk" and 
               "Replace and strike". Submitted in December, 1990, origin 
               unknown. 
       Sex Revolution V1.1: Submitted in December, 1990, this variant is 
                            similar to Stoned-B.  This variant may display 
                            the following message: 
                               "EXPORT OF SEX REVOLUTION ver. 1.1" 
       Sex Revolution V2.0: Similar to Sex Revolution V1.1, the message 
                            has been changed to: 
                               "EXPORT OF SEX REVOLUTION ver. 2.0" 
       Stoned-16: The variant does not contain a text string as the 
                 original text string in the Stoned virus has been 
                 replaced with binary zeros.  On 5.25 inch 360K diskettes, 
                 the boot sector will not be saved by the virus.  On 5.25 
                 inch 1.2M diskettes, the original boot sector is saved at 
                 sector 17, part of the root directory.  The system hard 
                 disk's master boot sector will have been relocated to 
                 Side 0, Cyl 0, Sector 16. 
                 Origin:  Unknown  May, 1992. 
       Stoned-1991 Boot: Submitted in May, 1992, this variant of Stoned 
                 differs in that it infects the boot sector of the DOS boot 
                 partition of the hard disk, overwriting the original boot 
                 sector.  It infects diskettes similar to the original 
                 Stoned, moving the original boot sector on 360K 5.25" 
                 diskettes to sector 11.  It does not contain typical 
                 Stoned virus messages, but does contain the text string 
                 "1991" near the beginning of the virus. 
                 Origin:  Unknown  May, 1992. 
       Stoned-A: Same as Stoned above, but does not infect the system 
                 hard disk.  This is the original virus and is now extinct. 
                 The text found in the boot sector of infected diskettes 
                 is: "Your computer is now stoned.  Legalize Marijuana". 
                 The "Legalize Marijuana" portion of the text is not 
                 displayed. 
       Stoned.Angelina: Similar to Stoned indicated above.  This 
                 variant contains the following encrypted text string: 
                 "Greetings for ANGELINA !!!/by Garfield/Zielona Gora" 
                 Origin:  Unknown  December, 1997. 
       Stoned.Arc Hub: Based on the Stoned virus above, this is a 
                 stealth variant.  When memory resident, it will hide 
                 the infection on disk.  Its size in memory is 2,048 
                 bytes.  This variant contains the following text 
                 string: 
                 "ARC HUB 8A" 
                 Origin:  Unknown  December, 1997. 
       Stoned-AT Love: Similar to the PS-Stoned variant, this variant 
                 moves the original boot sector on 5.25 inch 360K 
                 diskettes to sector 11, the last sector of the root 
                 directory.  On 1.2M 5.25 inch diskettes, the original boot 
                 sector will be moved to sector 17, in the middle of the 
                 root directory.  The master boot sector on the system hard 
                 disk will have been moved to Side 0, Cyl 0, Sector 17. 
                 It contains the following text string which may be 
                 displayed when the system is booted: 
                 "�available Your PC is now StNED in LVE with AT �becomes  
                 Origin:  Unknown  May, 1992 
       Stoned-B: Same as Stoned indicated above.  Systems with RLL 
                 controllers may experience frequent system hangs.  Text 
                 typically found in this variant is: "Your computer is now 
                 stoned.  Legalise Marijuana". The "Legalise Marijuana" 
                 may also be in capital letters, or may be partially 
                 overwritten.  It is not displayed. 
       Stoned-C: same as Stoned, except that the message has been 
                 removed. 
       Stoned-Collor: Similar to the original Stoned, this variant 
                 from Brazil's main distinction is that the text strings 
                 within the virus have been changed to: 
                 "Collor, um tiro basta!" 
                 "Call John" 
                 Origin:  Brazil  1991. 
       Stoned-D: same as Stoned, with the exception that this variant 
                 can infect high density 3.5" and 5.25" diskettes. 
       Stoned-E: Similar to Stoned-B, this variant now emits a "beep" 
                 through the system speaker when the following message is 
                 displayed: "Your PC is now Stoned!" The text "LEGALISE 
                 MARIJUANA!" can also be found in the boot sector and 
                 system master boot sector. 
       Stoned-F: Similar to Stoned-E, this variant also emits a "beep" 
                 through the system speaker when its message is 
                 displayed.  The displayed message is: "Twoj PC jest teraz 
                 be!" The text "LEGALISE MARIJUANA?" can also be found in 
                 the boot sector and system hard disk master boot sector. 
       Stoned II: Based on Stoned-B, this variant has been modified to 
                  avoid detection by anti-viral utilities.  Since its 
                  isolation in June, 1990, most utilities can now detect 
                  this variant.  Text in the virus has been changed to: 
                  "Your PC is now Stoned!  Version 2" Or: "Donald Duck is 
                  a lie." The "Version 2" portion of the text may be 
                  corrupted as well. 
       Stoned-LM: Based on the Stoned virus, this variant will only 
                  infect diskettes when the boot sector is directly accessed 
                  with read and write intent, usually resulting in a system 
                  hang.  The location of the original boot sector and the 
                  hard disk master boot sector is similar to the original 
                  Stoned virus described above. 
                  Origin:  Canada  October, 1992. 
       Stoned-Mexican: Discovered in Mexico in May, 1992, this variant 
                  of Stoned contains the following text string: 
                  "NO VOTES FOR EL PRI". 
                  Origin:  Mexico, May 1992. 
       Stoned Mutation: Submitted in June, 1992, Stoned Mutation is a 
                  minor variant of the Stoned virus.  Its major destinction 
                  is that it does not infect diskettes unless the diskette 
                  boot sector is accessed with write-intent.  It contains 
                  the same text strings as the original virus. 
                  Origin:  Unknown, June 1992. 
       Stoned-NSD: Isolated in October, 1991 in the Eastern United 
                   States, Stoned-NSD is a minor variant of the Stoned 
                   virus.  Its major difference is that the text strings 
                   have been altered to: "Non SYStEM dISc" and 
                   "LEGALISE MARIJUANA", though the second string will 
                   usually be corrupted to "LEGALISE4".  Once this second 
                   string is corrupted, all later infections will have 
                   the corrupted string.  Stoned-NSD can infect high 
                   density, 1.2M 5.25" diskettes, moving the original 
                   boot sector to sector 17. 
       Stoned-NZ: Received from New Zealand in October, 1991, this 
                  variant of Stoned has one slight difference.  It does 
                  not always save the original hard disk master boot sector 
                  when it infects the system hard disk.  The text string 
                  found in the virus is: "YOUR PC IS NOW STONED!".
