 General Comments: 
       The Scream, or Screaming Fist, virus was isolated in Canada in 
       February, 1992.  Scream is a memory resident infector of .COM and 
       .EXE programs, including COMMAND.COM. 
 
       The first time a program infected with the Scream virus is executed, 
       this virus will install itself memory resident at the top of system 
       memory but below the 640K DOS boundary, moving interrupt 12's 
       return.  Total system and available free memory, as indicated by 
       the DOS CHKDSK program, will have decreased by 2,048 bytes. 
       Interrupts 21 and 24 will be hooked by Scream in memory.  Also at 
       this time, the virus will check to see if C:\COMMAND.COM has been 
       infected by the virus.  If it is not infected, the virus will 
       promptly infect it.  The copy of COMMAND.COM located on the current 
       drive may also become infected. 
 
       Once the Scream virus is memory resident, it will infect .COM and 
       .EXE programs when they are executed or opened for any reason. 
       Infected .COM programs will have a file length increase of 711 bytes. 
       Infected .EXE programs will have a file length increase of 711 to 
       1,191 bytes.  In both cases, the virus will be located at the end 
       of the infected program.  The file's date and time in the DOS disk 
       directory listing will not have been altered. 
 
       Two text strings can be found in the Scream viral code in all 
       infected programs: 
 
               "Screaming Fist" 
               "C:\COMMAND.COM" 
 
       It is unknown if Scream does anything besides replicate. 
 
       Known variant(s) of Scream are: 
       Scream 1B: The Scream 1B virus is functionally equivalent to 
                 the Scream virus described above.  It has four bytes 
                 which differ from the original. 
                 Origin:  Canada  April, 1992. 
       Scream 2: The Scream 2 virus is based on the Scream virus.  It 
                 adds 838 bytes to the .COM programs it infects, and 838 
                 to 1,318 bytes to .EXE programs.  Like Scream, the virus 
                 will be located at the end of the infected file.  This 
                 variant is encrypted, and no text strings are visible in 
                 its viral code in infected files. 
                 Origin:  Canada  February, 1992. 
       Scream 2B: The Scream 2B virus is a 692 byte variant of the 
                 Scream virus.  When it is memory resident, total system 
                 and available free memory, as measured by the DOS 
                 CHKDSK program, will have decreased by 2,048 bytes. 
                 Interrupts 21 and 24 will be hooked by Scream 2B.  Once 
                 Scream 2B is resident, it will infect .COM and .EXE 
                 programs when they are executed, opened, or copied.  .COM 
                 programs will increase in size by 692 bytes.  .EXE 
                 programs will have a file length increase of 898 to 1,172 
                 bytes.  In both cases, the virus will be located at the 
                 end of the infected file. 
                 Origin:  Canada  April, 1992. 
       Scream 2C: The Scream 2C virus is functionally identical to 
                 Scream 2B.  It is a minor variant. 
                 Origin:  Canada  April, 1992. 
       Scream 2-696: The Scream 2-696 virus was discovered in the 
                 United States in May, 1992.  When it is memory resident, 
                 total system and available free memory, as measured by 
                 the DOS CHKDSK program, will have decreased by 2,048 
                 bytes, and interrupt 21 will be hooked.  Once it is 
                 memory resident, it will infect .COM and .EXE programs 
                 when they are executed, opened, or copied.  .COM programs 
                 will have a file length increase of 696 bytes.  .EXE 
                 programs will have increased in size by 902 to 1,176 
                 bytes.  In both cases, the virus will be located at the 
                 end of the infected file.  Scream 2-696 is polymorphic, 
                 employing a complex encryption mechanism.  As of May, 
                 1992, it was confirmed by several large infections to 
                 be in the public domain, and is considered a common virus 
                 in the United States as a result. 
                 Origin:  Canada  May, 1992. 
       Scream 2-732: The Scream 2-732 virus was isolated in the 
                 United States in May, 1992.  It is similar in many 
                 respects to the Scream 2-696 variant.  .COM programs, 
                 however, will increase in size by 732 bytes.  .EXE programs 
                 will have a file length increase of 1,128 to 1,212 bytes. 
                 In both cases the virus will be located at the end of the 
                 file.  Like Scream 2-696, this variant is polymorphic. 
                 Origin:  United States  May, 1992. 
       Scream-650: The Scream-650 virus is a 650 byte variant of the 
                 Scream virus.  This virus infects the C: drive root 
                 directory copy of COMMAND.COM when the first infected 
                 program is executed.  It does not become memory resident 
                 until the system is booted from booted from the system 
                 hard disk and the infected copy of COMMAND.COM.  When it 
                 is memory resident, total system and available free memory, 
                 as measured by the DOS CHKDSK program, will have decreased 
                 by 2,048 bytes.  Interrupts 21 will be hooked by Scream-650. 
                 Once it is resident, it will infect .COM programs when they 
                 are executed, opened, or copied.  Infected programs will 
                 have a file length increase of 650 bytes with the virus 
                 being located at the end of the file.  The program's date 
                 and time in the DOS disk directory listing will not be 
                 altered.  The following text strings are encrypted within 
                 the viral code: 
                 "Screaming Fist (c)12/91" 
                 "C:\COMMAND.COM" 
                 Origin:  Canada  November, 1992. 
       Scream.839: Received in December, 1996, this is a 839 byte 
           variant of the Scream virus described above.  Its size in memory 
           is 1,024 bytes, hooking interrupt 21.  Once resident, it infects 
           .COM and .EXE files, including COMMAND.COM and the copy of 
           COMMAND.COM located in the C: drive root directory, when they 
           are executed or opened, but not on copy.  Infected .COM files 
           will have a file length increase of 839 bytes.  .EXE files will 
           increase in size by 839 to approximately 1,339 bytes as the virus 
           pads the file length to a multiple of 512 on .EXE files.  The 
           viral code will be located at the end of the file.  The program's 
           date and time in the DOS disk directory listing will not be 
           altered.  The following text strings are encrypted within the 
           viral code: 
           "Screaming FistII" 
           "C:\COMMAND.COM" 
           Origin:  Unknown  December, 1996. 
       Scream.846: Received in December, 1996, this is a 846 byte 
           variant of the Scream virus described above.  Its size in memory 
           is 1,024 bytes, hooking interrupt 21.  Once resident, it infects 
           .COM and .EXE files, including COMMAND.COM and the copy of 
           COMMAND.COM located in the C: drive root directory, when they 
           are executed or opened, but not on copy.  Infected .COM files 
           will have a file length increase of 846 bytes.  .EXE files will 
           increase in size by 846 to approximately 1,346 bytes as the virus 
           pads the file length to a multiple of 512 on .EXE files.  The 
           viral code will be located at the end of the file.  The program's 
           date and time in the DOS disk directory listing will not be 
           altered.  The following text strings are encrypted within the 
           viral code: 
           "Screaming FistII" 
           "C:\COMMAND.COM" 
           Origin:  Unknown  December, 1996.
