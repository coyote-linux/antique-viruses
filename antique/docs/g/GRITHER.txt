 General Comments: 
       The Grither virus was submitted in January, 1991, by Paul Ferguson 
       of the United States.  This virus is a non-resident direct action 
       infector of .COM files, including COMMAND.COM. 
 
       When a program infected with Grither is executed, the virus will 
       infect one .COM file in the current directory.  COMMAND.COM may 
       become infected if it exists in the current directory. 
 
       .COM programs infected with Grither will increase in length by 774 
       bytes, the virus will be located at the end of the infected file. 
       The file's date and time in the disk directory will not be altered 
       by the virus. 
 
       The Grither virus can be extremely destructive.  With a probability 
       of approximately one out of every eight times an infected program is 
       executed, the virus may activate.  On activation, Grither will 
       overwrite the beginning of the C: and D: drives of the system's hard 
       disk. Effectively, this corrupts the disk's boot sector, file 
       allocation tables, and directory, as well as the system files. 
 
       Grither is roughly based on the Vienna and Violator viruses.
