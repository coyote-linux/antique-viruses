 General Comments: 
       The Wanderer virus was received in November, 1993.  Its origin is 
       unknown.  Wanderer is a memory resident infector of .COM programs, 
       including COMMAND.COM. 
 
       When the first Wanderer infected program is executed, this virus 
       will install itself memory resident at the top of system memory but 
       below the 640K DOS boundary.  Total system and available free 
       memory, as indicated by the DOS CHKDSK program, will have decreased 
       by 416 bytes.  Interrupt 21 will be hooked by the virus in memory. 
 
       Once the virus is memory resident, it will infect .COM programs, 
       including COMMAND.COM, when they are executed.  Infected programs will 
       have a file length increase of 400 bytes with the virus being located 
       at the end of the file.  The program's date and time in the DOS disk 
       directory listing will not appear to be altered, though the seconds 
       field will have been set to "62".  The following text string is 
       visible within the Wanderer viral code in infected programs: 
 
               "As wolfs among sheep we have wandered"
