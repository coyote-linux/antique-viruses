 General Comments: 
       The Wharps virus was submitted in December, 1992.  Its origin or 
       point of isolation is unknown.  Wharps is a non-resident, direct 
       action infector of .COM programs, including COMMAND.COM. 
 
       When a program infected with the Wharps virus is executed, the 
       Wharps virus will infect one .COM program located in the current 
       directory.  Infected programs will have a file length increase of 
       572 bytes with the virus being located at the end of the file. 
       The file's date and time in the DOS disk directory listing will 
       appear to be unaltered, but actually the seconds field in the file 
       time will have been set to "62".  The following text strings are 
       encrypted within the Wharps viral code: 
 
               "[wHaRpS]" 
               "wHaRpS! It is 3:00 a.m. > ETERNAL" 
 
       The second text string is displayed by the virus when an infected 
       program is executed at 3:00 AM.  System hangs will also frequently 
       occur on infected systems.
