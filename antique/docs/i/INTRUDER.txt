 General Comments: 
       The Intruder virus was submitted in April, 1992.  This virus' 
       source code was published in "The Little Black Book of Computer 
       Viruses" by Ludwig in the United States in 1991.  It is a 
       non-resident direct action infector of .EXE programs. 
 
       When a program infected with the Intruder virus is executed, this 
       virus will infect one .EXE program in the current directory.  The 
       infected program will have a file length increase of 1,319 to 
       1,333 bytes with the Intruder virus' code being added to the end 
       of the host program.  The file's date and time in the DOS disk 
       directory listing will not be altered.  The following text strings 
       can be found in the viral code in infected programs: 
 
               "\*.EXE \*.*" 
               "????????EXE" 
 
       Systems infected with the Intruder virus may experience system 
       hangs when some infected programs are executed. 
 
       Known variant(s) of Intruder are: 
       Bell: Based on the Intruder virus described above, this variant 
             behaves similarly, and has been altered to avoid detection by 
             some anti-viral programs familiar with the original virus. 
             Like the original virus, it addes 1,326 to 1,340 bytes to the 
             .EXE programs it infects, and contains the following text 
             strings: 
             "\*.EXE \*.* \" 
             "????????EXE?"

                   will have a file length increase of 1,326 to 1,340 bytes 
                   with the virus being located at the end of the file. 
                   The program's date and time in the DOS disk directory 
                   listing will not be altered.  The following text strings
