;INSUFFICIENT MEMORY virus - by URNST KOUCH for Crypt Newsletter #6
;INSUFF MEMO is a simple MUTATION ENGINE loaded spawning virus, which 
;confines itself to the current directory. To assemble with TASM 2.5, user
;must have complete MTE091B software package (including RND.OBJ,
;MTE.OBJ and stubfile, NOPS.BIN). Use MAKE2.BAT included in this
;issue of the Crypt Newsletter to assemble all proper
;components. Observant readers will notice INSUFF MEMO takes advantage of
;VCL 1.0 code as well as notation from the SARA virus.  INSUFF MEMO is
;a non-threatening, unique example of an MtE-loaded companion virus -
;the only one in circulation, in fact.
;
;INSUFF2, included as a DEBUG script in this newsletter, is functionally        
;identical to this virus.  However, for those who 'require' a destructive
;program for their full enjoyment, it is loaded with a routine which
;simple checks the system time and branches to some 'dropper' code if
;after quitting time (4:00 pm).  The 'dropper' reads from a data table
;and writes the NOIZ trojan to any .EXE in the current directory. By
;looking carefully at this code, several areas where 'potentially'
;destructive/nuisance routines can be added will suggest themselves.
;We do not include them for a number of reasons: 1) they are easy to
;come by in any number of books on assembly coding, the VCL 1.0 (an
;excellent source), or source code archives on mnay BBS's, and; 2)
;it allows you to get creative if you want and tinker (like I do all the
; time) with the basic layout of virus source.
;        
;INSUFF3's source listing is modified to allow the virus to jump out        
;of the current directory when all files in it are infected.  The
;listing is publicly available at the BBS's listed at the end of the
;Crypt newsletter.
