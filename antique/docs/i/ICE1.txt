;       THE ICELANDIC "DISK-CRUNCHING" VIRUS
;
;       Another possible name for this virus might be "One-in-ten", since
;       it tries to infect every tenth program run. The Icelandic name for
;       this virus ("Diskaetuvirus") translates to "Disk-eating virus"
;
;       It was first located at one site in mid-June '89. It has since then
;       been found at a few other places, but is quite rare yet. So far it
;       does not seem to have spread to any other country.
;
;       Disassembly done in June/July '89.
;
;       The author of this program is unknown, but it appears to be of
;       Icelandic origin.

;
;       To anyone who obtains this file - please be careful with it, I
;       would not like to see this virus be distributed too much. The code
;       is very clear, and the virus is quite well written. It would be VERY
;       easy to modify it to do something really harmful.
;
;       A short description of the virus:
;
;       It only infects .EXE files. Infected files grow by 656 to 671
;       bytes, and the length of the infected file MOD 16 will always be 0.
;       The virus attaches itself to the end of the programs it infects.
;
;       When an infected file is run, the virus copies itself to top of
;       free memory, and modifies the memory blocks, in order to hide from
;       memory mapping programs. Some programs may overwrite this area,
;       causing the computer to crash.
;
;       The virus does nothing if some other program has hooked INT 13
;       before it is run. This is probably done to avoid detection by
;       protection programs, but it also means that many ordinary
;       programs like SideKick and disk cache software will disable it.
;       Even the PRINT command will disable the virus. This reduces the
;       spread of the virus, but also greatly reduces the possibility that
;       the virus will be detected.
;
;       The virus will hook INT 21H and when function 4B (EXEC) is called
;       it sometimes will infect the program being run. It will check every
;       tenth program that is run for infection, and if it is not already
;       infected, it will be.
;
;       The virus will remove the Read-Only attribute before trying to
;       infect programs.
;
;       Infected files can be easily recognized, since they always end in
;       4418,5F19.
;
;       To check for system infection, a byte at 0:37F is used - if it
;       contains FF the virus is installed in memory.
;
;       This virus is slightly harmful, but does no serious damage.
;       On floppy-only, or machines with 10Mbyte hard disks it will do
;       no damage at all, but on machines with larger hard disks it will
;       select one unused entry in the FAT table, and mark it as bad, when it
;       infects a file. Since the virus only modifies the first copy of the
;       FAT, a quick fix is simply to copy the second table over the first.
;       This is the only "mistake" I have found in this virus. It appears
;       to be very well written - What a shame the programmer did not use
;       his abilities for something more constructive.
;
;       This file was created in the following way: I wrote a small program,
;       that did nothing but write "Hello world!" and ran it several times,
;       until it became infected. I then diassembled the program, changed
;       it into an .ASM file, and worked on it until this file, when
;       assembled, produced the same file as the original infected one.
;
;       (Or almost the same - the checksum in the header is different).
