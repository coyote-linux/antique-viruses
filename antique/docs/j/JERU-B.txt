 General Comments: 
       The Jerusalem virus was originally isolated at Hebrew University in 
       Israel in the Fall of 1987.  As of November, 1991, it is thought to 
       have now originated in Italy.  Jerusalem is a memory resident 
       generic file infector.  Jerusalem viruses will infect .COM, .EXE, 
       .SYS, .BIN, .PIF, and overlay files when they are executed  .EXE 
       files may be reinfected by the virus each time they are executed due 
       to a bug in the viral code.  The Jerusalem virus has been altered 
       many times, and many other viruses have been based on its code.  The 
       description below is for a standard Jerusalem virus which reinfects 
       .EXE files when they are executed.  Other variants, or members of 
       this family, are indicated below. 
 
       The first time a program infected with the Jerusalem virus is 
       executed, the Jerusalem virus will install itself memory resident 
       as a low system memory TSR of 1,792 bytes.  Interrupts 08 and 21 
       will be hooked by the Jerusalem virus in memory. 
 
       Once the Jerusalem virus is memory resident, it will infect programs 
       other than COMMAND.COM when they are executed.  .COM programs will 
       increase in size by 1,813 bytes with the virus being located at the 
       beginning of the infected file.  .EXE programs will increase in 
       size by 1,808 to 1,822 bytes with the virus being located at the 
       end of the infected file.  Later, infected .EXE programs will be 
       reinfected by the virus when they are again executed.  Each 
       reinfection will add an additional 1,808 bytes to the file. 
       Jerusalem infected programs will have no change to their date and 
       time in the DOS disk directory. 
 
       This virus redirects interrupt 8, and 1/2 hour after execution of the 
       first infected program the system will slow down by a factor of 10. 
       Additionally, some Jerusalem virus variants will have a "black 
       window" or "black box" appear on the lower left side of the screen 
       which will scroll up the screen as the screen scrolls. 
 
       The Jerusalem virus activates after it becomes memory resident on 
       Friday the 13ths.  At that time, it will delete any program the user 
       attempts to execute. 
 
       The identifier for most Jerusalem strains is "sUMsDos", however, this 
       identifier may not be found in the newer variants of Jerusalem. 
 
       The Jerusalem virus is thought to have been based on the Suriv 3.00 
       virus, though the Suriv 3.00 virus was isolated after the Jerusalem 
       virus. 
 
       Known members(s) of the Jerusalem Family are: 
       A-204: Jerusalem with the sUMsDos text string changed to *A-204*, 
             and a couple of instructions changed in order to avoid 
             detection.  This variant will slow down the system after being 
             memory resident for 30 minutes, as well as having a black box 
             appear at that time. 
             Origin:  Delft, The Netherlands 
       Anarkia: Jerusalem with the timer delay set to slow down the 
             system to a greater degree, though this effect doesn't show 
             until a much longer time has elapsed.  No Black Box is ever 
             displayed.  The sUMsDos id-string has been changed to ANARKIA. 
             Lastly, the virus's activation date has been changed to Tuesday 
             the 13th, instead of Friday the 13th. 
             Origin:  Spain 
       Anarkia-B: Similar to Anarkia, with the exception that the virus 
             now activates on any October 12th instead of on Tuesday 
             the 13ths. 
       Antiviru: Similar to Jerusalem B, the Antiviru virus differs in 
             that it contains two text strings: "COMMAND.COM" and 
             "ANTIVIRU".  Like Jerusalem, it will display a "black box" 
             accompanied by a system slowdown 30 minutes after becoming 
             memory resident.  After the virus becomes memory resident on 
             Friday the 13ths, any program executed will be deleted. 
             Origin:  Unknown  January, 1992 
       Apocalypse: The Apocalypse variant of Jerusalem was received 
             from Europe in May, 1991.  It originated in Italy.  This 
             variant will infect programs as they are executed.  .COM 
             programs will increase in size by 1,813 bytes.  .EXE programs 
             will increase in size by 1,808 to 1,822 bytes with the first 
             infection, and 1,808 bytes on later reinfections.  The MsDos 
             infection marker in the virus has been altered to "C.J**". 
             Text strings which can be found in Apocalypse infected files 
             are: 
                      "Apocalypse!!!" 
                      "COMMAND.COM" 
                      "**C.J**" 
             The last string is what has replaced the sUMsDos string in the 
             original virus.  Apocalypse will have the characteristic "black 
             box" appear on the lower left hand side of the screen after it 
             has been memory resident for 30 minutes.  It does not, however, 
             delete programs on Friday the 13ths. 
             Origin:  Italy  May, 1991 
       Bogota: The Bogota virus was discovered in Bogota, Columbia in 
             May, 1992.  Its low system memory TSR is 2,048+ bytes in size, 
             hooking interrupts 16 and 21.  It adds 1,813 bytes to the .COM 
             programs it infected.  .EXE programs increase in size by 1,808 
             to 1,822 bytes with the first infection, and 1,808 bytes with 
             each reinfection.  Bogota will occassionally truncate .EXE 
             programs to zero bytes when they are executed. 
       Captain Trips: The Captain Trips variant was submitted in March, 
             1991, and is from the United States.  Its name comes from the 
             text string "Captain Trips X." which occurs within the viral 
             code.  Unlike most Jerusalem variants, this variant does not 
             display a black window after being memory resident for 30 
             minutes, nor does it slow down the system.  On Friday the 
             13th, it does not delete programs.  The text string "MsDos" 
             does not occur in infected programs.  .COM programs will 
             increase in size by 1,813 bytes.  .EXE programs will increase 
             in size by 1,808 to 1,822 bytes with the first infection of 
             the file, and then by 1,808 bytes with subsequent infections. 
             Origin:  United States  March, 1991. 
       Captain Trips 2: Captain Trips 2 was submitted in July, 1991. 
             It is a variant of the Captain Trips variant which has been 
             altered to avoid detection.  The major difference is that 
             reinfections of .EXE files have a file length increase of 1,813 
             bytes. 
             Origin:  United States  July, 1991. 
       Czech: The Czech variant of Jerusalem was received in April, 
             1992.  When the Czech variant becomes memory resident, it 
             installs a 1,984 byte TSR in memory with interrupts 08, 21, 
             and F8 being hooked.  Once it is memory resident, it will 
             infect programs other than COMMAND.COM when they are 
             executed.  .COM programs will have a file length increase of 
             1,735 bytes with the virus being located at the beginning 
             of the infected file.  .EXE programs will increase in size 
             by 1,735 to 1,749 bytes with the virus being located at the 
             end of the file.  This variant does not reinfect .EXE 
             programs.  After the Czech variant has been memory resident 
             for 30 minutes, it will display a reverse video box in the 
             upper left hand corner of the screen which contains the text 
             "Ha!Ha!".  It does not delete programs on Friday The 13ths. 
             Some anti-viral programs may detect this variant as the 
             Sunday virus. 
             Origin:  Unknown  April, 1992. 
       Dragon: The Dragon variant of Jerusalem was submitted in 
             April 1992.  This variant is functionally similar to the 
             original Jerusalem virus described above.  It contains the 
             text string "BDH  B T".  The MsDos identifier has been 
             changed to a hex character string.  It deletes programs 
             which are executed after the virus has become memory resident 
             on Friday The 13ths. 
             Origin:  Unknown  April, 1992. 
       Get Password 1: Get Password 1 is a Jerusalem variant which was 
             originally discovered in the first half of 1991 in Europe. 
             This variant's TSR is 1,840 bytes in length.  Get Password 1 is 
             a Novell network specific virus, it won't replicate unless the 
             Novell Netware drivers are present in memory.  The virus was 
             originally intended to capture the logon information when the 
             user logs onto the network, however this code does not function 
             properly and so there is no threat.  Get Password 1 is 1,914 
             bytes in length. 
             Origin:  Europe  1991. 
       January 25TH: Similar to Jerusalem B, the major difference with 
             this variant is that it will activate on January 25TH, at which 
             time it will delete any programs which the user attempts to 
             execute.  January 25TH doesn't reinfect .EXE files.  After 
             being memory resident for 30 minutes, it will have the "black 
             box" screen effect common to many Jerusalem variants.  The 
             "sUMsDos" text string has also been replaced with hex 00 
             characters. 
       January 25TH-B: Functionally equivalent to the January 25TH, 
             this variant has some slight code modifications. 
             Origin:  Unknown  January, 1992. 
       Jerusalem B: Similar to the original Jerusalem virus, this 
             variant does not reinfect .EXE files when they are executed. 
             Origin:  Israel  January, 1988.  
       Jerusalem-C: Jerusalem B without the timer delay to slow down the 
             processor. 
       Jerusalem-D: Jerusalem C which will destroy both copies of the FAT 
             on any Friday the 13th after 1990. 
       Jerusalem DC: Similar to Jerusalem, this variant has the sUMsDos 
             text string changed to 00h characters.  After being memory 
             resident for 30 minutes, the system will slow down by 30% and 
             the common "black window" will appear on the lower left side of 
             the screen. Like Jerusalem, it will infect .EXE files multiple 
             times.  This variant does not carry an activation date when it 
             will delete files, it appears for all intents to be "defanged". 
             Origin:  Washington, DC, United States 
       Jerusalem-E: Jerusalem D but the activation is in 1992. 
       Jerusalem-Polish: Based on the Jerusalem virus described above, 
             this variant has been altered slightly so that the "black box" 
             screen effect does not appear. 
             Origin:  Poland  October, 1992. 
       Jerusalem-PLO: Based on the Jerusalem virus described above, this 
             variant will delete files when they are executed during the 
             secondd half of the year.  It will replicate during the first 
             half of the year.  After the virus has been memory resident 
             for 30 minutes, a system slowdown will occur, but the 
             characteristic Jerusalem black box will not appear.  The 
             "sUMsDos" string in the original virus has been changed to 
             "sU?sDos".  Infected .COM files will increase in size by 1,813 
             bytes.  Infected .EXE files increase in size by 1,808 - 1,822 
             bytes with the first infection, and 1,808 bytes with each 
             reinfection. 
             Origin:  Unknown  November, 1991. 
       Jerusalem.2389: Based on the Jerusalem-B virus, Jerusalem.2389 is 
             a 2,389 byte variant.  Its memory resident TSR is 2,640 bytes, 
             and hooks interrupts 1C and 21.  It adds 2,389 bytes to the 
             .COM programs it infects with the virus being located at the 
             beginning of the file.  It adds 2,389 to 2,404 bytes to .EXE 
             programs with the virus being located at the end of the file. 
             .EXE programs are reinfected by the virus, adding an additional 
             2,389 bytes with each reinfection.  The following text strings 
             are visible within the viral code in infected programs: 
             "COMMAND.COM" 
             "AYTUBA=19722191!!" 
             Systems infected with the Jerusalem.2389 virus may find programs 
             interrupted while they are executed, and a message scrolling on 
             the system display from right to left in a non-english language. 
             "NICE FROM FAR FAR FROM NICE" is the only english text within 
             the scrolling message.  This text is encrypted within infected 
             files. 
             Origin:  Europe?  July, 1994. 
       Jerusalem.Suselfo: Similar to Jerusalem, this variant has the 
             sUMsDos text string changed to "sUSelFo", as well as having 
             been altered to avoid detection by some anti-viral utilities. 
             Origin:  Spain  March, 1994. 
       June 17TH: Based on the Jerusalem virus, June 17TH is a 1,530 
             byte variant.  Its memory resident TSR is 1,792 bytes, hooking 
             interrupt 21.  .COM programs increase in size by 1,535 bytes, 
             while .EXE programs increase in size by 1,530 to 1,544 bytes. 
             With .COM programs, the virus will be located at the beginning 
             of the file.  With .EXE programs, the virus is located at the 
             end of the file.  .EXE programs are not reinfected.  June 17TH 
             activates when it becomes memory resident when the system date 
             is between June 17TH and December 31st of any year, at which 
             time it will delete any program which the user attempts to 
             execute. 
             Origin:  Unknown  November, 1992. 
       JVT1: Similar to the original Jerusalem virus, the JVT1 variant's 
             major differences are that after being memory resident for 
             30 minutes, a vertical black box consisting of two characters 
             will appear in the very upper left hand corner of the system 
             display.  Another difference is that instead of deleting 
             programs on Friday the 13ths, it deletes them on Tuesday the 
             1st.  The "sUMsDos" text string within the virus has been 
             changed to "sUMsDns".  Like Jerusalem, it will reinfect .EXE 
             programs. 
       JVT1-B: Functionally equivalent to JVT1, this variant is a 
             slightly modified version. 
             Origin:  Unknown  January, 1992. 
       Mendoza: Based on the Jerusalem B virus, this variant does not 
             reinfect .EXE files.  It is also missing the black box effect. 
             Mendoza activates in the second half of the year (July - 
             December), at which time any day will have a 10% chance of 
             having all programs executed deleted. 
             Origin: Argentina 
       Messina: Similar to the original Jerusalem virus, Messina's 
             major difference is that the "sUMsDos" text string has been 
             changed to "Messina".  Infected .COM files increase in size 
             by 1,813 bytes.  Infected .EXE files increase in size by 1,808 
             to 1,822 bytes with the first infection, and 1,808 bytes for 
             each reinfection. 
             Origin:  Unknown  November, 1991. 
       Nemesis: Similar to the original Jerusalem virus, this variant's 
             major difference is in the area of text strings within the 
             virus.  The characteristic "sUMsDos" string has been changed to 
             "UM Do ".  Two other text strings can be found in infected 
             files: "NEMESIS.COM" and "NOKEY". 
             Origin:  Unknown  November, 1991. 
       New Jerusalem: The New Jerusalem virus is a variant of Jerusalem 
             which was uploaded to several BBSes in The Netherlands on 
             October 14, 1989.  It was modified to be undetectable by 
             some anti-viral utilities which were widely distributed at 
             that time. 
             Origin:  The Netherlands  October, 1989. 
       Oscar: The Oscar variant of Jerusalem is functionally 
             equivalent to the original virus.  It contains three 
             text strings: "sUMsDos", "COMMAND.COM, and "OSCAR NU". 
             .EXE programs will be reinfected by this variant. 
             On Friday the 13ths, it will delete executed programs. 
             Origin:  Unknown  April, 1992. 
       Payday: The Payday variant was isolated in The Netherlands by 
             Jan Terpstra in November, 1989.  A major behavioral change is 
             that Payday will activate on all Fridays except Friday the 13th. 
             Upon activation, it deletes all files executed. 
             Origin:  The Netherlands  November, 1989. 
       Park ESS: Isolated in October, 1990 in Happy Camp, California, 
             this variant is very similar to other Jerusalem viruses. 
             Infected .COM files increase in length by 1,813 bytes, and 
             infected .EXE files will increase in length by 1,808 to 1,822 
             bytes with the first infection, and 1,808 on later subsequent 
             infections.  This variant will also infect COMMAND.COM.  The 
             other major difference from the "normal" Jerusalem is that the 
             "sUMsDos" string has been replaced.  The string "PARK ESS" can 
             be found in the viral code within all infected files.  This 
             variant slows down the system by approximately 20 percent and 
             a "black window" will appear after the virus has been memory 
             resident for 30 minutes. 
       Phenome: The Phenome variant of Jerusalem B was received at the 
             same time as the Apocalypse variant.  This variant is similar 
             in behavior to Apocalypse, with the exception that 
             COMMAND.COM will also be infected if executed.  The text 
             strings found in this variant are: 
                    "MsDos" 
                    "PHENOME.COM" 
                    "*-*-*-*" 
             Phenome activates after becoming memory resident on Saturdays. 
             On Saturdays, programs will not execute, but simply return the 
             user to the DOS prompt.          
             Origin:  Italy  May, 1991. 
       Puerto: Isolated in June, 1990 in Puerto Rico, this variant is 
             very similar to the Mendoza variant, the virus contains the 
             sUMsDos id-string.  .EXE files may be infected multiple times. 
             Origin:  Puerto Rico  June, 1990. 
       Skism: Similar to the Skism-1 variant, the Skism variant of 
             Jerusalem's major difference is that the "SKISM-1" text 
             string has been changed to " SKISM ".  Functionally, it is 
             equivalent to Skism-1. 
             Origin:  Canada  January, 1992. 
       Skism-1: Isolated in December, 1990 in New York State, this 
             variant is similar to many other Jerusalems except with 
             regards to when and what it does upon activation.  Rather than 
             activate on Friday the 13ths and delete files, this variant 
             activates in the years 1991 and later on any Friday which 
             occurs after the 15th of the month.  On activation, it 
             truncates any file which is attempted to be executed to zero 
             bytes.  .COM files will increase in size upon infection by 
             1,808 bytes, .EXE files will increase by 1,808 to 1,822 bytes. 
             .EXE files will be reinfected by the virus.  The "sUMsDos" 
             string in the virus is now "SKISM-1".  Like Jerusalem, this 
             variant produces a "black window" 30 minutes after becoming 
             memory resident, and also slows down the system. 
             Origin:  Canada  December, 1990. 
       Soy Un: Based on the Jerusalem-B virus, Soy Un is a 2,064 byte 
             variant from Peru.  Its memory resident TSR is 2,336 bytes, 
             and hooks interrupt 21.  Soy Un adds 2,069 bytes to the .COM 
             programs it infects with the virus being located at the 
             beginning of the file.  It adds 2,064 to 2,078 bytes to .EXE 
             programs with the virus being located at the end of the file. 
             .EXE programs are not reinfected.  Most of the file length 
             increase will usually not be visible on infected programs when 
             the virus is memory resident as it will attempt to hide all by 
             1 to 16 bytes of the increase.  The following text strings 
             occur within the viral code: 
             "HACK1" 
             "COMMAND.COM" 
             "CHKLIST.CPS" 
             "Soy un Virus y mi nombre es - THE HACKER -  Lima - Per�" 
             Origin:  Peru  September, 1992. 
       Spanish JB: (Jerusalem F)  Similar to Jerusalem, it reinfects 
             .EXE files.  The increased file size on .COM files is always 
             1,808 bytes.  On .EXE files, the increased file size may be 
             either 1,808 or 1,813, with reinfection always adding 1,808 
             bytes to the already infected file.  No "Black Box" appears. 
             The characteristic "sUMsDos" id-string does not appear in the 
             viral code.  This variant is also sometimes identified as 
             Jerusalem E2. 
             Origin:  Spain 
       Sub-Zero: Received in April 1992, Sub-Zero is a modified 
             Jerusalem variant which does not display the characteristic 
             "black box" after being memory resident for 30 minutes, nor 
             does a system slowdown occur.  Sub-Zero contains the 
             following text strings: "LORD SKISM", "Sub-Zero NYHC", and 
             "ED EL". 
             Origin:  Canada  April, 1992. 
       Sub-Zero B: Received in May, 1992, Sub-Zero B is a slightly 
             modified version of the Sub-Zero variant.  On the last Friday 
             of any month after 1991 it will truncate files which are 
             executed, and will attempt to format the system hard disk 15 
             minutes after becoming memory resident on June 6. 
             Origin:  United States  May, 1992. 
       Sub-Zero C: Received in February 1994, Sub-Zero C is a modified 
             version of the Sub-Zero variant described above.  It has been 
             altered to avoid detection by some anti-viral utilities. 
             Origin:  Unknown  February, 1994. 
       Swiss 1813: Submitted in February, 1991, from Switzerland, this 
             Jerusalem variant does not exhibit the "black window" after 
             being memory resident for 30 minutes, nor does it slow down 
             the system. It also does not delete programs on Friday the 
             13th, or any other Friday.  The "sUMsDos" text string has been 
             changed to binary zeros. 
             Origin:  Switzerland  February, 1991. 
       Triple: Received in April, 1992, Triple is a Jerusalem variant 
             which has been altered to avoid detection by some virus 
             scanning programs.  Functionally, it is similar to the 
             original virus.  One text string can be found in the viral 
             code in infected programs:  "COMMAND". 
             Origin:  Unknown  April, 1992. 
       Ucender: Received in March, 1992, this variant of Jerusalem has 
             been altered to avoid detection by some anti-viral programs. 
             The "sUMsDos" text string has been changed to "UCNDER".  The 
             characteristic Jerusalem "black box" appears after the virus 
             has been memory resident for 30 minutes, and a system slow- 
             down will also occur at this time.  Ucender will reinfect 
             .EXE files, like the original virus.  This variant activates 
             on Friday The 13ths, at which time it will delete programs 
             which are executed. 
             Origin:  Argentina  March, 1992.
