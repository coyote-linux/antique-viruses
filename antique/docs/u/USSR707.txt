 General Comments: 
       The USSR 707 virus was submitted in December, 1990.  It is from the 
       USSR.  This virus is a memory resident infector of .COM programs, 
       including COMMAND.COM. 
 
       When the first program infected with the USSR 707 virus is 
       executed, this virus will install itself memory resident at the top 
       of system memory but below the 640K DOS boundary.  It will move the 
       interrupt 12 return so that the virus in memory cannot be 
       overwritten.  USSR 707 makes use of interrupt 21, which will now 
       map to the virus in high system memory.  Total system memory and 
       available free memory will be 720 bytes less than expected. 
 
       After USSR 707 is memory resident, any .COM program executed will 
       become infected by the virus.  Infected .COM programs will have a 
       file length increase of 707 bytes, the virus will be located at the 
       end of the file.  If COMMAND.COM is executed, it will be infected. 
 
       It is unknown if USSR 707 does anything besides replicate.
