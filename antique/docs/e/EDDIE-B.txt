; "Blessed is he who expects nothing, for he shall not be disappointed."
 
; The original source of one of the first Bulgarian viruses is in front of
; you.  As you may notice, it's full of rubbish and bugs, but nevertheless
; the virus has spread surprisingly quickly throughout the country and made a
; quick round the globe.  (It's well-known in Eastern and Western Europe, as
; well as in USA.) Due to the anniversary of its creation, the source is
; distributed freely.  You have the rights to distribute the source which can
; be charged or free of charge, with the only condition not to modify it.
; The one who intentionally distributes this source modified in any way will
; be punished!  Still, the author will be glad if any of you improves it and
; spreads the resulting executive file (i.e., the virus itself).  Pay
; attention to the fact that after you assemble the source, the resulting
; .COM file cannot be run.  For that purpose you have to create a three byte
; file, consisting of the hex numbers 0e9h, 68h, 0 and then to combine the
; two files.  Don't try to place a JMP at the beginning of the source.
 
; DISCLAIMER: The author does not take any responsability for any damage,
; either direct or implied, caused by the usage or not of this source or of
; the resulting code after assembly. No warranty is made about the product
; functionability or quality.
 
; I cannot resist to express my special gratitude to my "populizer" Dipl.
; eng. Vesselin Bontchev, who makes me famous and who, wishing it or
; not, helps very much in the spreading of my viruses, in spite of the fact
; that he tries to do just the opposite (writing programs in C has never
; led to any good).
; Greetings to all virus writers!
