 General Comments: 
       The Predator, or Predator-1072, virus was submitted in June, 1993. 
       Its origin or point of isolation is unknown.  Predator is a memory 
       resident stealth virus which infects .COM programs, including 
       COMMAND.COM.  It does not infect very small .COM programs. 
 
       When the first Predator infected program is executed, this virus 
       will install itself memory resident at the top of system memory but 
       below the 640K DOS boundary, moving interrupt 12's return.  Total 
       system and available free memory, as indicated by the DOS CHKDSK 
       program, will have decreased by 2,160 bytes.  Interrupts 13 and 21 
       will be hooked by Predator in memory. 
 
       Once the Predator virus is memory resident, it will infect .COM 
       programs, including COMMAND.COM, when they are executed or opened 
       for any reason.  Infected programs will have a file length increase 
       of 1,072 bytes, though the file length increase will be hidden when 
       Predator is resident in memory.  The file's date and time in the 
       DOS disk directory listing will appear to be unaltered, though 100 
       years has been added to the file date.  The virus is located at the 
       end of infected files.  The following text strings are encrypted 
       within the viral code: 
 
               "Predator virus  (c) Mar. 93  Priest" 
               ".COM" 
        
       Systems infected with the Predator virus will experience file 
       allocation errors being detected by the DOS CHKDSK program on all 
       infected files when the virus is memory resident.  The virus also 
       contains code to slowly corrupt files by randomly altering bytes 
       in read sectors. 
 
       Known variant(s) of Predator are: 
       Predator-1148: A 1,148 byte variant of the Predator virus 
                      described above.  This variant's size in memory is 
                      2,304 bytes.  It adds 1,148 bytes to the .COM 
                      programs it infects.  It contains the same 
                      encrypted text strings as the original virus. 
                      Origin:  Unknown  June, 1993. 
       Predator-1154: A 1,154 byte variant of the Predator virus 
                      described above.  This variant's size in memory is 
                      2,320 bytes.  It adds 1,154 bytes to the .COM 
                      programs it infects.  It contains the same 
                      encrypted text strings as the original virus. 
                      Origin:  Unknown  June, 1993. 
       Predator-1195: A 1,195 byte variant of the Predator virus 
                      described above.  This variant's size in memory is 
                      2,400 bytes.  It adds 1,195 bytes to the .COM 
                      programs it infects.  It contains the same 
                      encrypted text strings as the original virus. 
                      Origin:  Unknown  June, 1993.
