 General Comments: 
       The Ping Pong virus is a boot sector virus which was first reported 
       in March 1988.  The original Ping Pong virus only infects Floppy 
       Disks.  Later variants of this virus also infect the hard disk 
       boot sector as well. 
 
       When the virus activates, which is on a random basis, a bouncing 
       ball or dot appears on the screen.  This display can only be 
       stopped through a system reboot.  No other damage is apparently 
       done. 
 
       The original Ping Pong virus is extinct, though the hard disk 
       variant, Ping Pong-B listed below, is a common MS-DOS virus. 
 
       Known variant(s) of Ping Pong are: 
       Ping Pong-B: A later variant of the Ping Pong virus which can 
                    infect hard disk boot sectors. 
                    Origin:  Unknown  May, 1988. 
       Ping Pong-C: Similar to Ping Pong-B, this variant does not have 
                    the bouncing ball screen effect. 
                    Origin:  Argentina  June, 1990.
