 General Comments: 
       The Pixel virus was originally distributed in Greece in 1988 by 
       Pixel magazine.  It is a non-resident, direct action infector of 
       .COM files, including COMMAND.COM.  Since its original release, there 
       have been many variants of the Pixel virus which have been isolated. 
       These variants are listed below under known variants, or under the 
       entries indicated below. 
 
       When a program infected with the Pixel virus is executed, the Pixel 
       virus will infect all .COM files in the current directory, including 
       COMMAND.COM.  Infected files will have a file length increase of 
       345 bytes with the virus being located at the beginning of the 
       infected file.  The file's date and time in the DOS disk directory 
       will have been updated to the current system date and time when 
       infection occurred. 
 
       The following text strings can be found in programs infected with 
       the original Pixel virus: 
 
               "*.COM" 
               "=!= Program sick error:Call doctor or buy Pixel for cure 
                description" 
               "WB" 
  
       "WB" is the infection marker for the original Pixel virus, and is 
       found in the third and fourth bytes of all infected files. 
 
       The original Pixel virus doesn't do anything besides replicate. 
 
       Known variants of Pixel are: 
       MS-748: Based on the Pixel virus, MS-748 infects all of the .COM 
               programs located in the current directory when an infected 
               program is executed.  Infected programs will have a file 
               length increase of 748 bytes with the virus being located 
               at the beginning of the file.  The program's date and time in 
               the DOS disk directory listing will have been updated to the 
               current system date and time.  The following text strings can 
               be found near the beginning of all MS-748 infected programs: 
               "MS*.COM" 
               "*.EXE" 
               Origin:  Unknown, December, 1992 
       Pixel-257: Similar to the Pixel virus described above, this 
                  variant adds 257 bytes to the programs it infects. 
                  All infected programs will have had their file date and 
                  time changed to "4-24-80 12:04a".  Text strings found 
                  in this variant are: 
                  "*.COM" 
                  "Fucking hell:You wet pussy" 
                  The two character ASCII string "WB" will be located in 
                  the third and fourth bytes of all infected files, this 
                  is the infection marker for the virus.  Pixel-257 will 
                  display the second text string above when an infected 
                  program is executed after all of the .COM programs in 
                  the current directory have been infected.  At this 
                  point, the infected programs will not execute, but the 
                  user will be returned to the DOS prompt after the message 
                  is displayed. 
                  Origin: Unknown, January, 1992 
       Pixel-275: Similar to the Pixel-257 variant, this variant adds 
                  275 bytes to the files it infects.  It doesn't display 
                  the message, and infected programs will execute 
                  properly.  Text strings are the same as for Pixel-277. 
                  Origin: Unknown, January, 1992 
       Pixel-277: Similar to the Pixel virus described above, except 
                  that the virus is now 277 bytes in length, and does not 
                  contain any message text.  The original message text has 
                  been replaced with code to produce a parity error 
                  approximately 50% of the time when an infected program is 
                  executed. 
                  Origin: Bulgaria               Alias: V-277 
       Pixel-283: Similar to Pixel, this variant adds 283 bytes to the 
                  .COM files it infects.  Infected files will have had 
                  their file date and time in the DOS disk directory changed 
                  to "4-24-80 12:04a".  Text strings found in this variant 
                  are: 
                  "*.COM" 
                  "=!What a stupid you are !!!!!!!!" 
                  Pixel-283 doesn't do anything besides replicate. 
                  Origin: Unknown, January, 1992 
       Pixel-295: Similar to Pixel, this variant adds 295 bytes to the 
                  .COM files it infects.  Infected files will have had 
                  their file date and time in the DOS disk directory changed 
                  to "4-24-80 12:04a".  Text strings found in Pixel-295 are: 
                  "*.COM" 
                  "=!= Program sick error:Call doctor or buy PIXEL for 
                   cure description" 
                  Pixel-295 doesn't do anything besides replicate. 
                  Origin: Unknown, January, 1992 
       Pixel-297: Based on the Pixel virus, this variant infects all 
                  .COM programs in the current directory when an infected 
                  program is executed.  Infected programs will have a file 
                  length increase of 297 bytes with the virus being located 
                  at the beginning of the file.  The file's date and time 
                  in the DOS disk directory listing will not be altered. 
                  The following text strings can be found within the viral 
                  code of all Pixel-297 infected programs: 
                  "Happy Birthday,Cheef" 
                  "*.COM" 
                  Origin:  USSR, July, 1992. 
       Pixel-299: Similar to Pixel, except that the length of the virus 
                  is 299 bytes. 
                  Origin: Bulgaria               Alias: V-299 
       Pixel-342: Similar to Pixel, except that the length of the virus 
                  is 342 bytes.  The "WB" infection marker in the virus has 
                  been changed to "IV". 
                  Origin: Bulgaria, June, 1992. 
       Pixel-739: Similar to Pixel, except the length of the virus is 
                  now 739 bytes. Infected files will have had their file 
                  date and time set to the system date and time when 
                  infection occurred.  The only text strings within the 
                  viral code in infected programs are: "IV" (the infection 
                  marker) and "*.COM".  Pixel-739 is actually much smaller 
                  than 779 bytes in length, the remainder of the file 
                  length increase will contain characters from system 
                  memory. 
                  Origin:  Unknown, April, 1993. 
       Pixel-779: Similar to Pixel, except the length of the virus is 
                  now 779 bytes. Infected files will have had their file 
                  date and time set to the system date and time when 
                  infection occurred.  The only text strings within the 
                  viral code in infected programs are: "IV" (the infection 
                  marker) and "*.COM".  Pixel-779 is actually much smaller 
                  than 779 bytes in length, the remainder of the file 
                  length increase will contain characters from system 
                  memory. 
                  Origin:  Unknown, January, 1992 
       Pixel-837: Similar to Pixel, the length of the virus is now 
                  837 bytes.  Infected files will have had their file 
                  date and time set to the system date and time when 
                  infection occurred.  Text strings found in this variant 
                  are: 
                  "=!= I love you so much !!!" 
                  "-- Francis" 
                  "*.COM" 
                  Origin:  Unknown, January, 1992 
       Pixel-847: Similar to Pixel, except that the length of the virus 
                  is 847 bytes. 
                  Origin: Bulgaria                  Alias: V-847 
       Pixel-847B: Similar to Pixel-847, except that the message in the 
                  virus is now in Spanish and is: 
                  "=!= En tu PC hay un virus RV1, y esta es su quinta 
                   generacion". 
                  This variant was originally distributed by a magazine in 
                  Spain in file NOCARGAR.COM. 
                  Origin: Spain                     Alias: V-847B 
       Pixel-850: Similar to other members of this family, this variant 
                  was submitted in March 1991 from Europe.  Infected files 
                  will increase in size by 850 bytes, with the virus being 
                  located at the beginning of the infected program.  This 
                  variant contains the same message as the original Pixel. 
                  Origin: Europe, March 1991        Alias: Pixel 2 
       Pixel-850 Dropper: The Pixel-850 Dropper is the original "dropper" 
                  file of the Pixel-850 virus.  This program is 384 bytes in 
                  length, and when executed will infect all .COM files in 
                  the current directory with Pixel-850. 
                  Origin: Europe, March 1991        Alias: S-847 
       Pixel.851.B: Received in June, 1996, this is an 851 byte variant 
                  of the Pixel virus.  It infects all of the .COM files 
                  in the current directory, including COMMAND.COM, when 
                  an infected program is executed, and may display one 
                  line of characters from memory on the system monitor. 
                  Infected programs will have a file length increase of 
                  851 bytes with the virus being located at the beginning 
                  of the file.  The program's date and time in the DOS 
                  disk directory listing will have been updated to the 
                  current system date and time when infection occurred. 
                  The text string "SS" can be found starting in the fourth 
                  byte of all infected files.  The following additional 
                  text strings are visible within the viral code: 
                  "*.COM" 
                  "SSt!" 
                  Origin:  Unknown  June, 1996. 
       Pixel-852: Similar to the Pixel-847 variant, this variant does 
                  not contain any message.  The original sample of this 
                  variant received by the author did not contain any text; 
                  however, after replicating on a test system, all infected 
                  files then contained text from the video buffer, which 
                  implies the submitted sample was the original distribution 
                  of the virus.  This variant checks bytes 4-5 of .COM files 
                  to determine if the file was previously infected.  If 
                  bytes 4-5 are "SS", the virus assumes the file is already 
                  infected. 
                  Origin: Bulgaria                  Alias: V-852 
       Pixel-854: Similar to the Pixel-852 variant, Pixel-854 differs 
                  primarily in that it adds 854 bytes to the .COM files it 
                  infects. 
                  Origin: Unknown, January 1992. 
       Pixel.1268: Received in July, 1994, Pixel.1268 is a 1,268 byte 
                  variant of the Pixel virus described above.  It infects 
                  all of the .COM files located in the current directory, the 
                  \DOS directory (if it exists on the drive), as well as the 
                  current drive's root directory, each time an infected 
                  program is executed.  If the programs were previously 
                  infected by the virus, it will reinfect them.  Each 
                  infection by the virus adds 1,268 bytes to the .COM files. 
                  The virus will be located at the beginning of the file. 
                  The file's date and time in the DOS disk directory listing 
                  will have been updated to the current system date and time 
                  when the last infection or reinfection occurred.  The 
                  following text strings can be found within the viral code: 
                  "\DOS\" 
                  "*.COM \DOS\*.COM \*.COM" 
                  "PreComFileRunSyndrome 1993" 
                  "YOU HAVE ENTERED THE WRONG PASSWORD!!" 
                  "ENTER THE PASSWORD:" 
                  Origin: Unknown, July, 1994. 
       Portugal-500: Based on the Pixel virus, this virus was submitted 
                  from Portugal in May, 1992.  It is a non-resident virus 
                  which will infect all the .COM files in the current 
                  directory when an infected program is executed.  Infected 
                  programs will have a file length increase of 500 bytes 
                  with the virus being located at the beginning of the 
                  program.  The file's date and time in the DOS disk 
                  directory will have been updated to the system date and 
                  time when infection occurred.  Portugal-500 does not 
                  contain any text strings, and does do anything besides 
                  replicate. 
                  Origin: Portugal, May 1992.
