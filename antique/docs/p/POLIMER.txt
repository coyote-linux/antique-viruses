 General Comments: 
       The Polimer virus was discovered in Hungary in November, 1990. 
       This virus is a non-resident infector of .COM files, including 
       COMMAND.COM. 
 
       When a program infected with the Polimer virus is executed, the 
       following message will be displayed: 
 
             "A le' jobb kazetta a POLIMER kazetta !   Vegye ezt !" 
 
       This message can be found near the beginning of all infected files. 
 
       After the message is displayed, the virus will attempt to infect 
       one .COM file on the current drive and directory, and one .COM file 
       on the C: drive's current directory.  This virus will only infect 
       .COM files which are between 512 and 64,758 bytes in length.  If 
       the .COM file it attempts to infect has the Read-Only attribute, it 
       will not be infected, and the message $ERROR will be displayed. 
 
       Although this virus is actually 456 bytes in length, infected .COM 
       files will increase in size by 512 bytes with the virus's code 
       being located at the beginning of the file. 
 
       This virus does not appear to do anything besides replicating.
