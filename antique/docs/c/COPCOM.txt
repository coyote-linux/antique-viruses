 General Comments: 
       The Cop-Com virus was received in February, 1995.  Its origin or 
       point of isolation is unknown.  Cop-Com is a non-resident, direct 
       action infector of .COM files, including COMMAND.COM.  It permanently 
       corrupts the files it infects. 
 
       When a program infected with the Cop-Com virus is executed, the 
       following message requiring a response from the system user will 
       be displayed, where X is the current drive designation: 
 
               "General failure reading drive X 
                Abort, Retry, Ignore, Fail?" 
 
       If the system user replies "R" for "Retry", the virus will then 
       infect one .COM file located in the current directory.  If all of 
       the .COM files in the current directory are already infected by the 
       virus, the following message will be displayed: 
 
               "Program halted by Cop-Com 
                Unauthorized program on your system 
                Consult Local dealer for support" 
 
       Progrms infected with the Cop-Com virus will have the first 286 bytes 
       of the host program overwritten by the viral code, permanently 
       corrupting the host file.  The file's date and time in the DOS disk 
       directory listing will appear to be unaltered, though the seconds 
       field will be set to "62".  The following text strings are visible 
       within the viral code in all infected files: 
 
                "Program halted by Cop-Com" 
                "Unauthorized program on your system" 
                "Consult Local dealer for support"
