 General Comments: 
       The CV4 virus was received in July, 1992.  Its origin or point of 
       isolation is unknown.  CV4 is a non-resident, direct action infector 
       of .COM files, including COMMAND.COM. 
 
       When a program infected with the CV4 virus is executed, the CV4 
       virus infect one previously uninfected .COM file located in the 
       current directory.  If COMMAND.COM is located in this directory, 
       it may become infected.  Programs infected with the CV4 virus 
       will have a file length increase of 321 bytes with the virus 
       being located at the end of the infected file.  The program's 
       date and time in the DOS disk directory listing will not be 
       altered.  The following text strings can be found in the viral 
       code in all CV4 infected programs: 
 
               "This file infected with COMVIRUS 1.0" 
               "*.COM" 
 
       The first of these text strings is displayed on the system 
       monitor each time an infected program is executed. 
 
       CV4 doesn't do anything besides display its message and replicate.
