 General Comments: 
       The Coffeeshop-1568 virus was submitted in September, 1992.  It is 
       probably from Sweden.  Coffeeshop-1568 is a memory resident infector 
       of .COM and .EXE programs, but not COMMAND.COM.  It is not encrypted 
       with the Dark Avenger Mutating Engine, though there are two viruses 
       known as Coffeeshop and Coffeeshop 2 which do use the mutating 
       engine.  See the entry for  DAME  for these other Coffeeshop viruses. 
 
       The first time a program infected with the Coffeeshop-1568 virus 
       is executed, Coffeeshop-1568 will install itself memory resident at 
       the top of system memory but below the 640K DOS boundary, not moving 
       interrupt 12's return.  Total system and available system memory, as 
       measured by the DOS CHKDSK program, will have decreased by 1,824 
       bytes.  Interrupt 21 will be hooked by Coffeeshop-1568 is memory. 
 
       Once memory resident, Coffeeshop-1568 will infect .COM and .EXE 
       programs when they are executed.  Infected programs will increase 
       in size by 1,568 bytes with the virus being located at the end of 
       the file.  The program's date and time in the DOS disk directory 
       listing will not be altered.  One text string appears within the 
       viral code in all infected programs: 
 
               "CoffeeShop" 
 
       It is unknown if Coffeeshop-1568 does anything besides replicate.
