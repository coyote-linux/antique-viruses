 General Comments: 
       The Chad virus was submitted in September, 1992.  It is originally 
       from England.  Chad is a non-resident, direct action infector of 
       .COM programs, including COMMAND.COM. 
 
       When a program infected with the Chad virus is executed, this 
       virus will search the current directory to locate a previouly 
       uninfected .COM program to infect.  If one is found, it will 
       be infected by the virus.  Programs infected with the Chad virus 
       will have a file length increase of 751 bytes with the virus 
       being located at the end of the file.  The program's date and 
       time in the DOS disk directory listing will appear to be blank 
       or missing, though it has actually been set to 00-00-80 00:00. 
 
       The following text strings can be found within the Chad viral 
       code in all infected programs: 
 
               "*.COM" 
               "Software ....." 
               "WOT!!  No Anti - Virus" 
               "CHAD Against Damaging Viruses ... Save Our Software. 1992." 
 
       The Chad virus contains code to display the message above once the 
       10th generation of the virus has occurred.
