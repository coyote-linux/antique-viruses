 General Comments: 
       The Vienna virus was first isolated in April, 1988, in Moscow at a 
       UNESCO children's computer summer camp.  The Vienna virus is a 
       non-resident, direct action infector of .COM programs, including 
       COMMAND.COM. 
 
       When a program infected with the Vienna virus is executed, the 
       virus will select a .COM program in the current directory which as 
       previously not been modified by the virus.  Usually, the Vienna 
       virus will infect this file and set the seconds in the file's time 
       in the disk directory to 62.  Infected programs will have a file 
       length increase of 648 bytes with the virus being located at the 
       end of the infected program. 
 
       One out of every six programs which Vienna selects will not be 
       actively infected by the virus.  Instead, the first five bytes of 
       the selected .COM program will be changed to the hex character 
       string "EAF0FF00F0", and the seconds field in the file time will be 
       set to 62.  When these programs are later executed, a system warm 
       boot may occur.  Since these corrupted programs do not actually 
       contain the Vienna virus, and most anti-viral programs cannot 
       detect them, systems which have been infected by Vienna will 
       continue to experience unexpected reboots until all of the 
       corrupted .COM programs have been replaced with clean copies. 
 
       Some programs will hang upon execution after they have been 
       infected by the Vienna virus. 
 
       The Vienna virus was written by a high school student in Vienna 
       Austria as an experiment.  Its large number of variants, as well as 
       other viruses which are in part based on Vienna code, can be 
       accounted for as its source code has been published many times. 
 
       Due to the large number of variants, Vienna infections may not 
       exhibit exactly the symptoms indicated above. 
 
       Known variant(s) of Vienna are: 
       Cracky: Submitted in June, 1992, Cracky is a 546 byte variant of 
             the Vienna virus which will only replicate on 8088 based 
             systems.  On 286 and higher based systems, execution of an 
             infected program will result in a system hang, or the text 
             "Cracky !" being displayed in the upper left hand corner of 
             the screen and a system hang when the next program, command, 
             or .BAT file is executed.  On XT based systems, Cracky will 
             infect one .COM file each time an infected program is 
             executed.  Infected programs will have a file length increase 
             of 546 bytes with the virus being located at the end of the 
             infected file.  The seconds field in the file time in the 
             DOS disk directory entry will have been set to 22, the virus' 
             infection marker.  The display of the text "Cracky !" may 
             also occur on 286 and higher systems, along with the system 
             hang.  The following text strings can be found within the 
             viral code in all infected files: 
             "Cracky !" 
             "*.com" 
             Origin:  Unknown  June, 1992 
       DOS 625: DOS 625 is a 625 byte variant of the Vienna virus.  It 
             contains the text strings "????????COM", "PATH=", and "om OM". 
             It is similar in behavior to the original Vienna virus, though 
             it does not do anything besides replicate. 
             Origin: Unknown  February, 1992 
       Dr Q:   Dr Q is a 1,161 byte variant of the Vienna virus.  It 
             contains the text string "(C) DOCTOR QUMAK" within the viral 
             code in all infected programs. 
             Origin: Unknown  November, 1991 
       Dr Q-1028:   Dr Q-1028 is a 1,028 byte variant of the Dr Q 
             virus described above.  It contains the text string 
             "(C) DOCTOR QUMAK" within the viral code in all infected 
             programs, as well as the following encrypted text strings: 
             "Hello world from my virus !" 
             "Infecks" 
             "stuff that should be here" 
             This variant infects one .COM program in the current directory 
             each time an infected program is executed.  Infected programs 
             will increase in size by 1,028 bytes and have no change in the 
             file's date and time in the DOS disk directory listing. 
             Occassionally, execution of an infected program will result 
             in the display of the "Hello world from my virus !" message. 
             Origin: Unknown  September, 1992 
       Genny-648: Genny-648 is a 648 byte variant of the Vienna virus. 
             It either infects or trojanizes one .COM program each time 
             an infected program is executed.  Infected programs will 
             have a file length increase of 648 bytes with the virus 
             being located at the end of the infected file.  Trojanized 
             programs will be altered so that they reboot the system when 
             they are executed, the first five bytes having been altered. 
             Like the original Vienna, this variant sets the seconds in 
             the file's timestamp to 62 to indicate infection. 
             Origin: Unknown  March, 1992 
       Kuzmitch: Kuzmitch is a 1,064 byte variant of the Vienna virus. 
             It will infect one .COM file in the current directory, but 
             not COMMAND.COM, each time an infected program is executed. 
             Infected files will have a file length increase of 1,064 - 
             1,222 bytes with the virus being located at the end of the 
             infected file.  It is unknown if it does anything besides 
             replicate. 
             Origin: Unknown  February, 1992 
       Maxwell-498:   Maxwell-498 is a 498 byte variant of the Vienna 
             virus.  It infects one .COM file in the current directory 
             each time an infected program is executed, but not COMMAND.COM. 
             The following text strings can be found within the viral code: 
             "MaxWell Defender: I don't kill MMM" 
             "PATH=*.COM" 
             As with the original virus, the file date/time seconds field 
             will be set to "62" on all infected programs. 
             Origin: Unknown  June, 1993 
       Maxwell-499:   Maxwell-499 is a 499 byte variant of the Vienna 
             virus.  It infects one .COM file in the current directory 
             each time an infected program is executed.  The following text 
             strings can be found within the viral code: 
             "MaxWell-Defender: I haven't been in Vienna" 
             "PATH=*.COM" 
             As with the original virus, the file date/time seconds field 
             will be set to "62" on all infected programs. 
             Origin: Unknown  June, 1993 
       New Generation: New Generation is a 1,054 byte variant of the 
             Vienna virus.  It will infect one .COM file in the current 
             directory, including COMMAND.COM, each time an infected 
             program is executed.  Infected files will have a file length 
             increase of 1,054 bytes with the virus being located at the 
             end of the infected file.  On every 20th generation of the 
             virus, it will display the following message on the system 
             monitor: 
             "         New Generation Virus 1.0ï¿½ by NET CRASHER, 
              a PROUD member in Hyper.  This message appears in a generation 
              that is devided by 20. Please don't remove this virus, it 
                       was created for research purposes only. 
                                                              Get a Life!" 
             The above message is encrypted within the viral code, as are 
             the following two additional text strings: 
             "*.com PATH=" 
             "?????????COM" 
             Infected files will have the seconds field in the file time 
             in the DOS disk directory set to 62. 
             Origin: Israel  October, 1992 
       Twer-1000: Twer-1000 is a 1,000 byte variant of the Vienna virus. 
             It will infect one .COM file in the current directory each 
             time an infected program is executed.  Infected files will have 
             a file length increase of 1,000 bytes with the virus being 
             located at the end of the infected file.  The file's date and 
             time in the DOS disk directory listing will appear to be 
             unaltered, but the seconds field has actually been changed to 
             "60".  The following text strings can be found within the 
             viral code in all Twer-1000 infected programs: 
             "Twer 1991" 
             "*.COM" 
             "PATH=" 
             "????????COM" 
             Origin: Unknown  December, 1992 
       Vienna 822: Vienna 822 is similar to Vienna-B 645 in behavior. 
                   This variant will infect .COM programs, including 
                   COMMAND.COM, increasing their length by 822 bytes. 
                   It does not perform either a warm reboot or delete 
                   executed programs. 
                   Origin: Europe  May, 1991 
       Vienna-415: Vienna-415 is a 415 byte variant of the Vienna 
                   virus which infects .COM programs located in the C: 
                   drive root directory.  It adds 415 bytes to the .COM 
                   programs it infects, including COMMAND.COM.  It sets 
                   the seconds in the file's time in the DOS disk directory 
                   to 62 to indicate the file is infected. 
                   Origin:  Unknown  August, 1992 
       Vienna-618: Vienna-618 is a 618 byte variant of the Vienna 
                   virus.  It adds 618 bytes to the .COM programs it 
                   infects, including COMMAND.COM.  It sets the seconds 
                   in the file's time in the DOS disk directory to 62 
                   to indicate the file is infected.  Once all the 
                   programs in the current directory have become infected, 
                   execution of an infected program will result in a 
                   system hang. 
                   Origin:  Unknown  April, 1992 
       Vienna-621: Vienna-621 is functionally similar to the Vienna-618 
                   virus.  It adds 621 bytes to the .COM programs, 
                   including COMMAND.COM, which it infects.  Like 
                   Vienna-618, it sets the seconds in the file's time to 
                   62 to indicate infection. 
                   Origin:  Unknown  April, 1992 
       Vienna-634 Reboot: Vienna-634 Reboot is a 634 byte variant of 
                   the Vienna virus described above.  It infects one .COM 
                   file, including COMMAND.COM, each time an infected 
                   program is executed.  Approximately 25% of the time 
                   when an infected program is executed, a program will 
                   be altered instead of infected.  The alteration will 
                   result in the system being rebooted the next time the 
                   program is executed. 
                   Origin:  Europe  November, 1991. 
       Vienna-645: Similar to the Vienna-B 645 variant, this variant 
                   adds 645 bytes to the .COM programs it infects.  It does 
                   not trojanize some programs to perform a warm reboot. 
                   It contains the text strings "*.COM", "PATH=", and 
                   "????????COM". 
                   Origin:  Unknown  April, 1992. 
       Vienna-648E: Based on the original Vienna virus, this variant 
                   adds 648 bytes to the .COM programs it infects.  It 
                   alters some .COM files, rather then infecting them, by 
                   overwriting the first five bytes with hex 20 characters. 
                   The seconds field in the file time will be set to 62 on 
                   all trojanized and infected programs.  It contains the 
                   text strings "*.COM", "PATH=", and "????????COM". 
                   Origin:  Unknown  October, 1992. 
       Vienna.648.Oscar.A: Received in February, 1995, this variant is 
                   a 648 byte minor variant of the Vienna virus described 
                   above.  The seconds field in the file date and time of 
                   all infected files will be set to "58".  The following 
                   text strings are visible within the viral code in all 
                   infected files: 
                   "(C) OSCAR" 
                   "*.COM" 
                   "PATH=" 
                   "????????COM" 
                   Origin:  Unknown  February, 1995. 
       Vienna.648.Oscar.B: Received in February, 1995, this is a minor 
                   variant of the Vienna.648.Oscar.A variant.  It contains 
                   the same text strings, and also sets the file date and 
                   time seconds to "58" on all infected programs. 
                   Origin:  Unknown  February, 1995. 
       Vienna.648.Oscar.C: Received in February, 1995, this is another 
                   minor variant of the Vienna.648.Oscar.A variant. 
                   Origin:  Unknown  February, 1995. 
       Vienna-656: Vienna-656 is a 656 byte variant of the Vienna virus. 
                   When an infected program is executed, it will infect one 
                   .COM file in the current directory, as well as accessing 
                   the C: drive.  It doesn't infect anything on the C: 
                   drive, but may crosslink the C: drive's file allocation 
                   table. 
                   Origin:  Europe  November, 1991. 
       Vienna-712: Vienna-712 is a 712 byte variant of the Vienna 
                   virus.  This variant will occasionally trojanize a 
                   program instead of infecting it.  When these trojanized 
                   programs are executed, a warm system reboot will 
                   occur. 
                   Origin:  Unknown  April, 1992. 
       Vienna-716: Vienna-716 is 716 byte variant of the Vienna virus. 
                   Execution of programs infected with this variant may 
                   result in "Divide overflow" errors occurring, or possible 
                   system hangs. 
                   Origin:  Europe  November, 1991. 
       Vienna-726: Vienna-726 is a 726 byte variant of the Vienna virus. 
                   Like Vienna, it infects one .COM file in the current 
                   directory each time an infected program is executed. 
                   Approximately 50% of the time when an infected program 
                   is executed, a warm reboot will occur following a long 
                   disk access.  The following text strings can be found 
                   in infected files: 
                   ".COM" 
                   "(c) Copyright IBM Corp 1981, 1987 Licensed Material" 
                   "- Program Property of IBM" 
                   Origin: Europe  November, 1991 
       Vienna-726B: Similar to Vienna-726, this variant has six bytes 
                    which differ. 
                    Origin: Europe  November, 1991 
       Vienna-827: Based on the Vienna virus, this variant adds 827 
                   bytes to the .COM programs it infects.  Like Vienna, it 
                   infects one .COM program each time an infected program 
                   is executed, locating the virus at the end of the 
                   infected program.  The following text strings can be 
                   found in the viral code: 
                   "Alan Solomon" 
                   "Doctor of what?" 
                   "Thinks he's a copper," 
                   "A copper he's not." 
                   "HVPOW YXNHM SUWXM XXCPO MX" 
                   "*.COM" 
                   "PATH=" 
                   "????????COM" 
                   The seconds field in the file date and time within the 
                   DOS disk directory will be set to "60" on all infected 
                   files. 
                   Origin:  Unknown  January, 1994. 
       Vienna-851: Based on the Vienna virus, this variant adds 851 
                   bytes to the .COM programs it infects.  Like Vienna, it 
                   infects one .COM program each time an infected program 
                   is executed, locating the virus at the end of the 
                   infected program.  The following text strings can be 
                   found in the viral code: "PATH=", "????????COM", and 
                   "*.COM".  System hangs frequently occur when infected 
                   programs are executed. 
                   Origin:  Unknown  August, 1993. 
       Vienna-943: Based on the Vienna virus, this variant adds 943 
                   bytes to the .COM programs it infects.  Like Vienna, it 
                   infects one .COM program each time an infected program 
                   is executed, locating the virus at the end of the 
                   infected program.  The following text strings can be 
                   found in the viral code: "PATH=", "????????COM", and 
                   "*.COM".  System hangs frequently occur when infected 
                   programs are executed.  The following message may also 
                   be occassionally displayed: 
                   "Have a NICE day...r is no longer operational due to an 
                    outbreak of". 
                   Origin:  Unknown  March, 1992. 
       Vien6: Similar to Vienna, except that the warm reboot has been 
              removed.  Effective length of the virus is still 648 bytes. 
              After 7 files have become infected on the current drive, the 
              virus will then start infecting .COM files on drive C:. 
       Vienna-Abacus: Based on the original Vienna virus, this variant 
                   adds 648 bytes to the .COM programs it infects.  It 
                   alters some .COM files, rather then infecting them, by 
                   overwriting the first five bytes with hex 20 characters. 
                   The seconds field in the file time will be set to 62 on 
                   all trojanized and infected programs.  It contains the 
                   text strings "*.COM", "PATH=", "????????COM", and 
                   "Abacus Software!". 
                   Unexpected system reboots may occur when trojanized 
                   programs are executed. 
                   Origin:  Unknown  October, 1993. 
       Vienna.Ambalama: Received in January, 1995, this variant of Vienna 
                   infects all of the .COM files in the current directory 
                   when an infected program is executed.  Infected files 
                   increase in size by 493 bytes with the virus being located 
                   at the the end of the file.  The file's date/time seconds 
                   field will have been set to "08".  The following text 
                   strings can be found within the viral code: 
                   "(C) BLACK STAR Inc., 1991. USA,BOX 13263,Ambalama 
                    Called from: BBS (095) 135-62-53" 
                   "\????????.COM" 
                   "????????COM" 
                   "ft 1988" 
                   After an infected program has been executed, the disk 
                   drive may become unreadable until the system is rebooted. 
                   Origin:  Unknown  January, 1995. 
       Vienna-B: Similar to Vienna, except that instead of a warm reboot, 
                 the program being executed will be deleted. 
       Vienna-B 645: Similar to the Vienna-B variant, this variant's 
                     effective length is 645 bytes.  It does not perform 
                     either a warm reboot or delete executed programs.  It 
                     does, however, infect COMMAND.COM 
                     Origin: United States 
       Vienna-Beta Boys: Received from Sweden in August, 1992, this 
              variant of Vienna adds 679 bytes to the .COM programs it 
              infects, including COMMAND.COM, and sets the seconds field 
              in the file time to 62.  The following text strings can be 
              found in all infected programs: 
              "-+[BetaBoys]+-" 
              "*.COM" 
              "PATH=" 
              "????????COM" 
              Beta Boys activates when an infected program is executed in 
              February of any year, overwritting the beginning of drives 
              C:, D:, and E:. 
              Origin:  Sweden  August, 1992
