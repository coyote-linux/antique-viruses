 General Comments: 
       The VX-163 virus was submitted in December, 1992.  Its origin or 
       point of isolation is unknown.  VX-163 is a non-resident, direct 
       action infector of .COM programs, including COMMAND.COM. 
 
       When a program infected with the VX-163 virus is executed, the 
       VX-163 virus will infect one .COM program located in the current 
       directory.  Infected programs will have a file length increase of 
       163 bytes with the virus being located at the beginning of the 
       file.  The program's date and time in the DOS disk directory listing 
       will not be altered.  The following text string is visible within 
       the viral code in all VX-163 infected programs: 
 
               "*.com" 
 
       VX-163 does not infect .COM programs in the current directory once 
       the first five .COM programs in the directory have become infected. 
 
       VX-163 doesn't do anything besides replicate, though system hangs 
       frequently occur when infected programs are executed.
