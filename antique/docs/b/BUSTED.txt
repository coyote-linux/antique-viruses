 General Comments: 
       The Busted virus was received in February, 1992.  Its origin, or 
       point of isolation, are unknown.  Busted is a non-resident, 
       direct action overwriting virus which infects .EXE programs. 
 
       When a program infected with the Busted virus is executed, this 
       virus will infect all .EXE programs located in the current directory. 
       Once the virus has completed infecting all .EXE programs in the 
       current directory, the following message will be displayed: 
 
               "Program too big to fit in memory" 
 
       Infected programs will have the first 571 bytes of their code 
       overwritten by the virus, permanently damaging them.  There will 
       be no change to the file's length unless the .EXE program was 
       originally smaller than 571 bytes, in which case the length will 
       become 571 bytes.  The program's date and time in the DOS disk 
       directory listing will not have been altered. 
 
       Several text strings are contained within this virus, though they 
       are encrypted in all replicated samples.  These text strings are: 
 
               "Busted!" 
               "This is based on Leprosy-B." 
               "Thanx PCM2" 
               "Busted, Strain A, version 1.08y" 
               "(Psychogenius), September '91" 
 
       Busted does not appear to do anything besides replicating, 
       destroying the .EXE programs it infects.
