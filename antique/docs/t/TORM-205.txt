 General Comments: 
       The Tormentor-205 virus was received from Sweden in July, 1992. 
       This virus is a non-resident, direct action infector of .COM 
       programs, including COMMAND.COM.  It is by the same author as 
       The Tormentor and Tormentor-1072 viruses. 
 
       When a program infected with the Tormentor-205 virus is executed, 
       this virus will infect all the .COM files located in the 
       current directory.  Infected .COM programs will have a file length 
       increase of 205 bytes with the virus being located at the end of 
       the file.  The program's date and time in the DOS disk directory 
       listing will have been updated to the current system date and 
       time when infection occurred.  The following text strings can 
       be found within the viral code in all Tormentor-205 infected 
       programs: 
 
               "(c) 1992 Tormentor ,Swedish Virus Laboratory" 
               "/ Demoralized Youth /" 
               "*.COM" 
 
       Systems infected with Tormentor-205 may receive unexpected error 
       messages when attempting to execute infected programs.  These 
       error messages include "Exec failure" and "Too many files open". 
       Infected programs will usually not run properly. 
 
       Known variant(s) of Tormentor-205 are: 
       Tormentor-263: Tormentor-263 is a 263 byte variant of the 
                      Tormentor-205 virus described above. It infects all 
                      .COM programs in the current directory when an 
                      infected program is executed.  Infected programs will 
                      have a file length increase of 263 bytes with the 
                      virus being located at the end of the infected file. 
                      The file's date and time in the DOS disk directory
