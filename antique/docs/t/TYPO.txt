 General Comments: 
       The Typo COM virus is similar to the Typo Boot virus in that it 
       will garble data that is sent to the parallel port once it has 
       activated.  Unlike the Boot virus, the .COM virus infects generic 
       .COM files.  This virus was first reported by Joe Hirst of Brighton, 
       UK, in November, 1989. 
 
       The Typo COM virus only infects .COM files on even-numbered days. 
 
       Known variant(s) of Typo COM are: 
       Typo-712: Typo-712 is a 712 byte variant of the Typo COM virus. 
                 It infects all .COM files in the current directory 
                 each time an infected program is executed, adding its 
                 viral code to the end of the file.  Its memory resident 
                 portion is 224 bytes in size and hooks interrupt 16.  It 
                 may intermittently interfer with keyboard input. 
                 Origin:  Unknown  December, 1991. 
       Typo-867B: Typo-867B is a minor variant of the original Typo COM 
                 virus.  It infects all .COM files in the current directory 
                 when an infected program is executed.  It also installs 
                 a 480 byte TSR which hooks interrupt 16.  Infected files 
                 will have a file length increase of 867 bytes with the 
                 virus being located at the end of the infected file. 
                 Origin:  Unknown  May, 1992.
