 General Comments: 
       The Timid virus was discovered in the state of Oregon in the 
       United States in December, 1991.  Timid is a non-resident, direct 
       action infector of .COM programs, including COMMAND.COM.  Timid 
       appears to be an escaped research virus, and has been found in the 
       public domain.  It was submitted by Wallace Hale of Canada. 
 
       When a program infected with Timid is executed, the Timid virus was 
       look for an uninfected .COM program located in the current directory 
       to infect.  The first uninfected .COM program encountered will be 
       infected by the virus.  If no uninfected .COM programs exist in 
       the current directory, a system hang will occur. 
 
       Timid infected .COM files will have a file length increase of 306 
       bytes.  The virus will be located at the end of the infected file. 
       The file's date and time in the DOS disk directory listing will 
       have been updated to the system date and time when infection 
       occurred.  Two text strings can be found in the viral code: 
 
               "VI" 
               "*.COM" 
 
       The first of these strings, "VI", will be located in the fourth and 
       fifth byte of infected files.  Together with a jump (E9h) instruction 
       located at the beginning of the infected file, it forms the infection 
       marker used by the virus to determine if the file was previously 
       infected by Timid. 
 
       Attempts to boot the system from an disk with an infected COMMAND.COM 
       will result in a system hang.  Execution of infected programs will 
       yield unexpected results, such as beeping, or a file name being 
       displayed.  Infected programs will not execute properly. 
 
       Known variant(s) of Timid are: 
       Hehheh: Received in November, 1992, Hehheh is a 320 byte variant 
                of the Timid virus.  It infects one program or file in the 
                current directory each time an infected program is executed. 
                Infected files may be of any type, including data files, as 
                the virus uses a search argument of *.*.  Infected files 
                will have a file length increase of 320 bytes with the virus 
                being located at the end of the file.  The program's date 
                and time in the DOS disk directory listing will have been 
                updated to the current system date and time when infection 
                occurred.  After all of the files in the current directory 
                have been infected, execution of the next infected program 
                will result in the following message being repeatedly 
                displayed on the system monitor, accompanied by beeping: 
                "*.* HEH!HEH!HEH!HEH!" 
                This text string can be found within the viral code in all 
                Hehheh infected programs.

       Timid-305: Received in June, 1992, Timid-305 is one byte smaller 
                than the original Timid virus.  Execution of an infected 
                program will result in the virus searching the current 
                directory for an uninfected .COM program to infect.  If the 
                virus infects a program, it will then display the newly 
                infected .COM program's file name.  No beeping occurs with 
                this variant. 
                Origin:  Unknown  June, 1992 
       Timid.313: Received in July, 1995, Timid.313 is a 313 byte 
                variant of the Timid virus described above.  It infects 
                one .COM program in the current directory when an infected 
                program is executed.  Infected programs will have a file 
                length increase of 313 bytes with the virus being located 
                at the end of the file.  The program's date in the DOS

                "IV" can be found starting in the fourth byte of all infected 
                files.  One text string is visible within the viral code: 
                "*.COM". 
                This variant of Timid reinfects previously infected files, 
                and will reinfect the first .COM file in the directory 
                instead of moving down the directory to infect other files 
                on successive executions.  It will also display the name 
                of the file it is infecting on the system monitor. 
                Origin:  Unknown  July, 1995 
       Timid-371: Received in July, 1993, Timid-371 is a 371 byte 
                variant of the Timid-290 virus.  Execution of an infected 
                program will result in the virus searching the current 
                directory for an uninfected .COM program to infect.  If the 
                virus cannot find an uninfected .COM file to infect, it will 
                overwrite 16 sectors of the system hard disk starting at 
                Side 0, Cylinder 0, Sector 1.  After this has occurred, 
                any attempts to access the hard disk result in an "Invalid 
                drive specification" error.  Norton Disk Doctor can be used 
                to fix the system hard disk.  Infected programs have a file 
                length increase of 371 bytes with the virus being located at 
                the end of the file.  The program's date and time in the DOS 
                disk directory listing will have been updated to the current 
                system date and time when infection occurred.  The 
                characters "VI" can be found starting in the fourth byte in 
                all infected programs.  The other text string visible within 
                the viral code is "*.COM". 
                Origin:  North America  July, 1993 
       Timid-382: Received in June, 1993, Timid-382 is based on the 
                original Timid virus.  Execution of an infected program will 
                result in the virus searching the current directory for an 
                uninfected .COM program to infect.  If the virus infects a 
                program, it will then display the newly infected .COM 
                program's file name.  No beeping occurs with 
                this variant.  Infected programs will have a file length 
                increase of 382 bytes with the virus being located at the 
                end of the file.  The program's date and time in the DOS 
                disk directory listing will have been updated to the current 
                system date and time when infection occurred.  The text 
                string "VI" can be found starting in the fourth byte of all 
                infected files.  This variant may corrupt the system hard 
                disk's master boot record (partition table sector). 
                Origin:  Unknown  June, 1993 
       Timid-431: Received in June, 1993, Timid-431 is based on the 
                original Timid virus.  Execution of an infected program will 
                result in the virus searching the current directory for an 
                uninfected program to infect.  This variant will infect 
                .COM, .EXE, or .SYS files.  Infected programs will have a 
                file length increase of 431 bytes with the virus being 
                located at the end of the file.  The program's date and time 
                will not be altered in the DOS disk directory listing.  The 
                text string "GR" can be found starting in the fourth byte 
                of all infected files.  Users of infected systems may 
                experience boot failures and programs failing to function 
                properly.

       Timid-526: Received in July, 1993, Timid-526 is based on the 
                original Timid virus.  Execution of an infected program will 
                result in the virus searching the current directory for an 
                uninfected file to infect.  This variant will infect both 
                program and data files, with the exception that in the root 
                directory it will only infect the hidden system files and 
                COMMAND.COM.  Infected files, both program and data, will 
                have a file length increase of 526 bytes with the virus 
                being located at the end of the file.  The program's date 
                and time will not be altered in the DOS disk directory 
                listing.  The text string "GR" can be found starting in the 
                fourth byte of all infected files.  Users of infected 
                systems may experience boot failures, programs failing to 
                function properly, and data corruption when non-executable 
                programs become infected.  If the virus does not encounter 
                an uninfected file to infect, it may slowly alter the system 
                display until it is left blank.  A system hang will then 
                occur.

       Timid-557: Received in July, 1993, Timid-557 is based on the 
                original Timid virus.  Execution of an infected program will 
                result in the virus searching the current directory for an 
                uninfected file to infect.  This variant will infect both 
                program and data files, with the exception that in the root 
                directory it will only infect the hidden system files and 
                COMMAND.COM.  Infected files, both program and data, will 
                have a file length increase of 557 bytes with the virus 
                being located at the end of the file.  The program's date 
                and time will not be altered in the DOS disk directory 
                listing.  The text string "GR" can be found starting in the 
                fourth byte of all infected files.  Users of infected 
                systems may experience boot failures, programs failing to 
                function properly, and data corruption when non-executable 
                programs become infected.  If the virus does not encounter 
                an uninfected file to infect, it will slowly drop characters 
                down the system's display if it is in text mode, and then 
                later move them back into place.

                and time in the DOS disk directory listing will have been 
                updated to the current system date and time when infection 
                occurred.  Infected programs will contain the text string 
                "LM" starting in the fourth byte of the file.  The other 
                text string found in the viral code is "*.COM".

       Timid-Orig: The original Timid virus whose source code was 
                published in "The Little Black Book of Computer Viruses" 
                by Mark Ludwig.  When a program infected with the Timid- 
                Orig virus is executed, the virus will search the 
                current directory for an uninfected .COM program to 
                infect, and then infect it.  After it has infected 
                a program, it will display the name of the program it 
                has just infected.  Files infected with Timid-Orig will 
                have a file length increase of 306 bytes with the virus 
                being located at the end of the program.  The file's 
                date and time in the DOS disk directory will have been 
                updated to the system date and time when infection 
                occurred.  The Timid-Orig virus does not cause beeping 
                to occur on the system speaker.
