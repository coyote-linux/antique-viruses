 General Comments: 
       The T-1000 virus was submitted in December, 1992.  T-1000 is a 
       non-resident, direct action overwriting virus which infects .COM 
       programs, including COMMAND.COM.  It corrupts the programs it 
       infects. 
 
       When a program infected with the T-1000 virus is executed, the 
       T-1000 virus will infect all of the .COM programs located in the 
       current directory, and then display the following message: 
 
               "T-1000" 
 
       A system hang will then occur. 
 
       Programs infected with the T-1000 virus will have the first 128 
       bytes of the host program overwritten by the T-1000 viral code. 
       Infected programs will have no increase in file length unless they 
       were originally smaller than 128 bytes, in which case they will 
       become 128 bytes in length.  The program's date and time in the 
       DOS disk directory listing will have been updated to the current 
       system date and time.  The above message, along with the following 
       text string, is encrypted within the viral code: 
 
               "*.Com"
