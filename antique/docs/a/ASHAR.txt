 General Comments: 
       The 3Y virus was received in July, 1994.  Its origin or point of 
       isolation is unknown.  3Y is a memory resident infector of .COM 
       files, but not COMMAND.COM. 
 
       When the first 3Y infected program is executed, the 3Y virus 
       will install itself memory resident at the top of system memory but 
       below the 640K DOS boundary, not moving interrupt 12's return.  Total 
       system and available free memory, as indicated by the DOS CHKDSK 
       program, will have decreased by 1,328 bytes.  Interrupt 21 will be 
       hooked by the virus in memory. 
 
       Once the 3Y virus is memory resident, it may infect .COM files when 
       they are executed, though it does not infect all .COM files.  Infected 
       programs will have a file length increase of 853 bytes with the virus 
       being located at the end of the file.  The program's date and time in 
       the DOS disk directory listing will not be altered.  The following 
       text strings are visible within the viral code in all infected files: 
 
               "COMMAND." 
               "3Y_06b.COM Ver0.6b  Copyright 1992 3Y2H" 
               "R3Y_06a.EXE" 
 
       It is unknown what 3Y does besides replicate.
