 General Comments: 
       The African 109 virus was isolated in January, 1992 in the 
       Republic of South Africa by Oliver Steudler and Peter Stoffberg 
       of the Virus Resource Centre.  African 109 is a non-resident, 
       direct action infector of .COM files, including COMMAND.COM. 
 
       When a program infected with African 109 is executed, the African 
       109 virus will infect all previously uninfected .COM files in the 
       current directory.  If COMMAND.COM happens to be in this directory, 
       it will be infected as well. 
 
       Programs infected with African 109 will have a file length increase 
       of 109 bytes.  The virus will be located at the beginning of the 
       infected file.  The file's date and time in the DOS disk directory 
       will have been updated to the current system date and time when 
       infection occurred.  One text string can be found in the viral code 
       in infected files: 
 
               "*.COM" 
 
       African 109 doesn't do anything besides replicate.
