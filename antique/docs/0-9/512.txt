 General Comments: 
       The 512 virus is not the same as the original Friday The 13th COM 
       virus.  The 512 virus was originally isolated in Bulgaria in 
       November, 1989, by Vesselin Bontchev.  It infects .COM files, 
       including COMMAND.COM, installing itself memory resident when the 
       first infected program is run.  After becoming memory resident, any 
       .COM file opened for any reason will become infected if its 
       uninfected length is at least 512 bytes. 
 
       Systems infected with the 512 virus may experience program crashes 
       due to unexpected errors, as well as system hangs.  Damage may occur 
       to infected files if the system user runs CHKDSK with the /F 
       parameter as the length of the program in the directory entry will 
       not match the actual disk space used.  CHKDSK will then adjust the 
       file allocation table, resulting in damaged files. 
 
       The virus's alias of "Number of the Beast" virus is because the 
       author of the virus used a signature of text 666 near the end of the 
       virus to determine if the file is already infected.  Since 512 adds 
       its viral code to the end of infected files, it is easy to verify 
       that a file is infected by the 512 virus by checking for that 
       signature. 
 
       Known variant(s) of 512 are: 
       512-B: Similar to the 512 variant, except that the DOS version check 
              in the original virus has been omitted.  The author's 
              signature of '666' has been omitted. 
       512-C: Similar to the 512-B variant, minor code changes. 
       512-D: Similar to the 512-C variant, except that the virus no longer 
              checks to see if a file has the System Attribute on it before 
              infecting it. 
       512-E: Similar to the other 512 viruses, this variant will use some 
              memory above 640K, such as memory on video cards.  Infected 
              systems will have a 55,104 byte decrease in total system and 
              available free memory as indicated by the DOS CHKDSK program. 
              This variant does not use the text 666 signature to designate 
              infected files. 
       512-F: Similar to other variants, the DOS CHKDSK program will not 
              show any decrease in system or available memory when the 
              virus is resident.  The "666" text signature can be found in 
              infected files as offset 1FD.
