 General Comments: 
       The 1575 virus was first isolated in Ontario, Canada, in January, 
       1991. This virus has been widely reported, and is believed to be 
       from the Far East, probably Taiwan.  It is a memory resident 
       infector of .COM and .EXE files, and will infect COMMAND.COM. 
 
       When the first program infected with the 1575 virus is executed, the 
       virus will install itself memory resident in 1,760 to 1,840 bytes at 
       the top of system memory, but below the 640K DOS boundary.  This 
       memory is not reserved, and may be overwritten later by another 
       program.  Interrupt 21 will be hooked by the virus.  COMMAND.COM on 
       the system C: drive root directory will also be infected at this 
       time. 
 
       Once the 1575 virus is memory resident, it will infect one .COM and 
       one .EXE program on the current drive whenever a DOS DIR or COPY 
       command is executed.  This virus does not spread when programs are 
       executed. 
 
       Infected files will have their file date and time in the DOS 
       directory updated to the system date and time when the infection 
       occurred. Their file lengths will also show an increase of between 
       1,577 and 1,591 bytes.  This virus will be located at the end of 
       infected files. 
 
       Some variants of this virus will have a green caterpillar appear on 
       the system display, similar to the original Centipede game creature. 
 
       Known variant(s) of 1575 are: 
       1575-B: This variant is functionally similar to the 1575 virus 
               described above.  The major difference is that this variant 
               reserves the memory it occupies at the top of system memory, 
               though the interrupt 12 return is not moved. 
       1575-C: Similar to the 1575-B, this variant will infect files as 
               they are executed in addition to when a DOS DIR or COPY 
               command is issued.  System may hang when this variant 
               infects COMMAND.COM. 
       1575-D: Execution of an infected program will result in the C: 
               drive COMMAND.COM program becoming infected.  Later booting 
               the system from the C: drive will result in the virus 
               becoming memory resident, with programs being infected when 
               they are copied (both source and target), or when a DIR 
               command is issued.  This variant is also known as Green 
               Caterpillar due to the graphic caterpillar which sometimes 
               will appear and eat all the characters from the system 
               display. 
       1575-E: Execution of an infected program will result in the C: 
               drive COMMAND.COM program becoming infected.  The virus will 
               then become memory resident the next time an infected program 
               is executed.  Its size at the top of system memory but below 
               the 640K DOS boundary is 1,840 bytes, hooking interrupt 21. 
               1575-E infects .COM and .EXE programs when a DOS DIR command 
               is executed, or a program is executed.  Infected programs 
               increase in size by 1,575 - 1,591 bytes with the virus being 
               located at the end of the file.  The file's date and time in 
               the DOS disk directory listing will have been updated to the 
               System date and time when infection occurred.  This variant 
               has been altered to avoid detection by some anti-viral 
               programs. 
               Origin:  Australia  October, 1992. 
       1575-Libin: Fairly similar in behavior to 1575-E, this variant has 
               been altered to avoid detection by some anti-viral utilities. 
               Origin:  Unknown  October, 1993.
