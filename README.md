The C source code for the Morris Worm has also been added to the archive. This is
the first Internet worm to gain media attention and to result in a felony conviction.
The worm was written by Robert Morris Jr. and released in November 1988. It took 
advantage of a flaw in Sendmail to spread itself. More information can be found in the
