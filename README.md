Assembler source for nearly 1000 very old (DOS) viruses

This source code is provided as-is and is for educational and research purposes only.

The virus sources contained in this repository are for DOS viruses dating back to the 
late 1980's. There are no executables in this repo and the malware will not likely
function on modern systems. 

Additional old virus sources have been added from: https://github.com/guitmz/virii This
is a very similar project which contained a large number of overlaps with the exiting 
repo.

The C source code for the Morris Worm has also been added to the archive. This is
the first Internet worm to gain media attention and to result in a felony conviction.
The worm was written by Robert Morris Jr. and released in November 1988. It took 
advantage of a flaw in Sendmail to spread itself. More information can be found in the
Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_worm

The decompiled version of the Stuxnet virus has been added for study. For more
information about this worm, check out the Wikipedia article:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet

The Stuxnet virus source was decompiled and published to github by a couple of 
security researchers. For more information about them, see the readme file in the 
famous/stuxnet directory.

The directory structures have been shuffled a bit to add some additional organization
to the repository.
